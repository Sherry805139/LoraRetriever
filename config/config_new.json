Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred.

Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \"coal,\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. \n\nQuestion: \"What did the second quasi-legendary dynasty give rise to the concept of?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Dragons\"\n\nIs this answer correct?\n\nOPTIONS:\n- no\n- yes",

In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society.

His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA. \nDo you have any questions?",

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. \nWhat question would one ask from this paragraph?",

Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad.

It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow.

Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go.

While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes.

To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \"The Plan,\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the  Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War.

To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against  Bin Laden and al Qaeda.

My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's  Bin Laden unit did\"extraordinary and commendable work,\" his chief of station in London \"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the  Bin Laden unit].\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). \n\nQuestion: \"Why did Clarke feel it was important to fund the CIA and counterterrorism more?\"\n\nAnswer: \"Because CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War\"\n\nIs this answer correct?\n\nOPTIONS:\n- no\n- yes",

That era was capped in 1998, when the Legal Services Corp. forced 275 legal aid providers nationwide to combine into 179. To comply with the orders from their main funding source, a new species of poverty lawyer emerged - a tech-savvy and button-down breed who swapped neighborhood walkin offices for toll-free phone lines, self-help kiosks and Internet access to legal advice.

There was a generous amount of the delicate bird throughout and plenty of veggies too. The portion was easily enough for two meals. I believe I ordered 5 on the heat scale, I don't recall as there was poolside beer drinking involved, but the heat was just right, not overwhelming. If you have it for dinner, add the leftover rice to the remaining curry so it will soak up all the delicious heat! I did get hooked on the green curry and had it again on my 2nd go, but this time with chicken, same level of heat. Out of this world!  It's so convenient and we had our orders delivered very fast.

Great rooms, great service, everything was first class.  Complimentary Limo rides from/to the airport was a blast for the kids (included if you are staying at Sky Suites). :)  The only negative during our stay - I booked a poolside cabana for the day ($200) and it would have been perfect except our water cooling spray thing wasn't working.  It took over 3 hrs and multiple requests before it was fixed for the row of cabanas we were in.  Very annoying.  They did take off $100 from our charge, but only after I asked for it.  I'm not a high roller so I had to pay for the rooms and so on, but all in all I was happy with the overall experience for my group (except for the cabana thing noted above).  If you are looking to get a little of that high roller experience without having to spend thousands of dollars per night or lose a crapload of money at the tables :), I would highly recommend the Aria Sky Suites.  My 2BR Sky Suite was $600 per night for a Sun and a Mon night.  Aria poker room is one of the better places on the strip.  Not as big as Bellagio, but relatively large and lots of loose action.\n\nOPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive",

I've seen some complaints in price hikes such as the Unagi (fresh water eel), but the market price has gone up in the last several years by 60-70%, so it's not their fault.  Service is usually pretty good, but it can get pretty busy on some evenings.  Luckily, they have some complimentary bread rolls and mini-cinnamon toasts.

We got placed in the back on the restaurant and it took the waiter 25 minutes to even realize that we were there and take our drink orders!!! Wth?! Also many other staff members walked right by us not asking if we were okay because I kept looking around for service.  Finally a girl that was cleaning saw us and grabbed the server right anyway. Ugh.  We were waiting for a party so we decided to just order drinks to start.  We sat there for a good while not being checked up on, with no sauces on our table, or even asked if we wanted appetizers while we waited.  I was livid.  When the waiter finally did come back, we decided to just order before he disappeared again.  Also while we were sitting there were at least 6 staff members (the hostess included) just standing around chit-chatting in the empty area.  I noticed that the hostess was annoyed to be called to the front when patrons arrived.  When we did get our food, it was tasty as usual.  The service and professionalism was just lacking for a restaurant that was soooo empty.  We waited most of the night for any decent service and this is unacceptable because obviously the waiters/waitresses had nothing to do because they were able to be standing in the back area RIGHT BY US chit-chatting.

The corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed. Orwell's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I've read the book, but one hears references to Big Brother, the Thought Police, and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation.

In \"La Sanguinusa conduce la danza\", the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl, with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom. Naturally, the scene in Rizzo's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in Martino's film.

                "inputs": "Determine the sentiment:\n\nWARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS\n\nA couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.\n\nAn indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.\n\nTaking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out \"we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?\" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few \"haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars\" and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.\n\nActing is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written \"you're f**ked\". When prompted for the map, Carlos responds \"well the map says we're f**ked\". Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?\n\nOr how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. \"Nice hearing from you, Carlos\", quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.\n\nThe teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with \"shut the f**k up, man\" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.\n\n\nOPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive",

When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender  his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intents of her own, sent to recover an item from the bank owner's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank, and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, all you get it set-up in the film, and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless, cutthroat villain of sorts. Clive Owen isn't given much to do besides brood and pose, but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man, however, is how much unwarranted praise it has received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster, this one falls horribly flat."

As an avid reader, I find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. You can tell the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film.\n\nEllen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar. However, I think the Canadian actress (Christine Horne) chosen to play Hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise. I haven't seen any of Horne's previous work but I will definitely seek it out after seeing her Stone Angel performance.\n\nI heard the Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel is going to happen in Spring or Summer 2008.

I know little of Japanese cinema so I can't really judge the acting but considering the fact that the cast was speaking a language or extreme dialect foreign to them at one time or another and that a couple of them have almost no acting experience, I was rather impressed.\n\nIf you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, see this film. At least rent it since it's coming to Region 1.\n\nOn a side note, there is zero homosexual/homoerotic content in this film. I didn't even see much of a subtext.

Whilst living in La Paz,Guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt,bourgeois government there. Once again,Steven Soderberg takes up where 'Che:Part One' leaves off (only better this time). The pacing is more on target,the job of acting is ever so fine (including a turn by a sickly looking Benecio Del Toro,as Che Guevara). Suffice it to say,it's probably best if you see both films,to get the true story of Guevara & what kind of a man he was (I had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening----talk about a long haul!). As with 'Che-Part 1:The Argentine',this film has no MPAA rating, but contains enough salty language & violence to easily snag it an 'R'.\nOPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive",

A superb cast including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young sidekick, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a delightful ham, as always, in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture) helps immeasurably.\n\nThe ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight; this is a picture, that provided you get into it, you can remember long after it's over.\n\nThe promise of the open road is vividly displayed here; the countryside just looks beautiful. Set to Craig Safans' wonderful music score, it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics.\n\nIt loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions), but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters.\n\nNot at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock picture one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title, \"The Great Smokey Roadblock\"), it's a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without qualms.\n\n9/10\nHow would you describe the sentiment of this review?\nOPTIONS:\n- negative\n- positive",

Nice combination of strange 'dogma' style of telling the story together with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there's no 'the end'. As for me it's unacceptable. I was thinking... how it will be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ...and I have some idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little bit different. I'm sure that 3rd part without Helmer wouldn't be the same. So here's my suggestion. Mayble little bit stupid, maybe not. I know that Lars likes to experiment. So why not to make small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (like for example \"team America\" by Trey Parker) or even computer 3d animation. I know it's not the same as real actors, but in principle I believe it could work... only this way it's possible to make actors alive again. For Riget fans this shouldn't be so big difference - if the animation will be done in good way average 'watcher' will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie. The most important thing now is the story. It's completely understandable that it's not possible to create Riget 3 with the actors nowadays. So why not to play with animation? And... look for the possibilities that it gives to you! Even marketing one! Great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation. Just dreams?\n\nI hope to see Riget 3 someday... or even to see just the script.

In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal only defended by the opposing team's goalkeeper. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional ``sudden-death'' rounds. Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team, and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play (including extra time, if any). Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a penalty kick, there are some differences.

There had already been a King George's War in the 1740s during the reign of King George II, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents, and it became known as the French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire. In Europe, the North American theater of the Seven Years' War usually is not given a separate name. The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years' War. \"Seven Years\" refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763.

The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnar's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right.\n\nA film version of the musical was made in 1956, starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones. It follows the musical's story fairly closely, although a prologue, set in the Starkeeper's heaven, was added. The film was released only a few months after the release of the film version of Oklahoma!. It garnered some good reviews, and the soundtrack recording was a best seller. As the same stars appeared in both pictures, however, the two films were often compared, generally to the disadvantage of Carousel. Thomas Hischak, in The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, later wondered \"if the smaller number of Carousel stage revivals is the product of this often-lumbering [film] musical\".  There was also an abridged (100 minute) 1967 network television version that starred Robert Goulet, with choreography by Edward Villella.  The New York Philharmonic presented a staged concert version of the musical from February 28 to March 2, 2013, at Avery Fisher Hall. Kelli O'Hara played Julie, with Nathan Gunn as Billy, Stephanie Blythe as Nettie, Jessie Mueller as Carrie, Jason Danieley as Enoch, Shuler Hensley as Jigger, John Cullum as the Starkeeper, and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin. Tiler Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle. The production was directed by John Rando. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote, \"this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear.\" It was broadcast as part of the PBS Live from Lincoln Center series, premiering on April 26, 2013.

                "inputs": "Answer by taking a quote from the following article:\n\nThe Wildhearts are an English rock group, formed in 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The band's sound is a mixture of hard rock and melodic pop music, often described in the music press as combining influences as diverse as The Beatles and 1980s-era Metallica. However, this characterization is denied by the band, who see their influences as being far broader, as shown in the song \"29 X The Pain\", which lists many of group leader Ginger's influences. Despite several top 20 singles and one top 10 album in Britain, the Wildhearts have not achieved major commercial success, owing in part to difficulties with record companies and many internal problems often relating to recreational drugs and depression.\n\nThe Wildhearts formed in late 1989, after Ginger was sacked from the Quireboys. An often-told story from this time period is that Ginger decided to start his own band after falling down a flight of stairs with a bottle of Jack Daniel's but emerging with the bottle intact. Had the bottle smashed, he would have slit his wrists with the shards, but instead he resolved to form a band in which he could exercise his songwriting skills, rather than just playing guitar as in his previous bands. Throughout the band's career, Ginger has written almost all the songs himself.  Initially called the Wild Hearts (two words), the band originally included singers Snake (ex-Tobruk) and Dunken F. Mullett (ex-Mournblade), who both joined for short periods. Nine demos were recorded in 1989 and 1990 with Snake singing on four and Dunken on five. These demos remain unreleased and displayed a sound resembling Guns N' Roses, with the Wildhearts sound still to be developed. Some of the demos were produced by Ric Browde and intended for an EP release that never materialized, though these demos are occasionally found on unofficial releases. In March 1991, Ginger reluctantly took over on lead vocals despite his reservations, as he has never thought himself a good singer.  After many early personnel changes, the line-up solidified around Ginger on guitar and vocals, CJ (Christopher Jagdhar) on guitar and vocals, Danny McCormack on bass and vocals, and Dogs D'Amour drummer Bam. This line-up released two EPs in 1992, Mondo Akimbo a-Go-Go and Don't Be Happy...Just Worry.  The Wildhearts next planned a double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the recording sessions. Instead the band released a collection of six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track \"Geordie In Wonderland\". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with Wolfsbane's Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included \"If Life Is Like A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft\", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic \"Sky Babies.\" Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play \"Sky Babies\" at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.  The second album proper was to be known as P.H.U.Q.. Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger (in a move he later claimed to regret) fired guitarist CJ, and some of the album's tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. P.H.U.Q. was released in May 1995 and reached #6 in the British charts, making it the band's most successful album. Shortly after the album's release, Mark Keds of Senseless Things was drafted as second guitarist, but lasted just one recording session, in which he appeared on the B-sides for the single \"Just in Lust\". Within a few weeks Keds was sacked after disappearing to Japan for a farewell tour with his old band. The Wildhearts were again down to a three-piece (Ginger, McCormack, and Battersby) for a few months, and performed a few gigs in this incarnation. The band resolved to return to a two-guitar formation, and after requesting demos and holding auditions, hired the previously unknown Jef Streatfield.  By late 1995 the band were finally fed up with their record label and set out to tour Japan and the UK, determined that they would split up unless East West would release them from their contract. The tours were a resounding success and eventually the band managed to escape their record contract.  Due to their large output of songs, but shortage of album opportunities due to conflicts with East West Records, the Wildhearts have long been known for a large number of extra tracks released as B-sides on CD singles. Prior to 1997 the band would release one version of a single which would contain two or three B-sides, and the B-sides were never album outtakes but would be recorded specifically for the single. Some of the A-sides, such as \"Caffeine Bomb\", were also recorded specifically as singles and did not originally appear on an album.  Starting in 1997 the Wildhearts began to release multiple formats of singles. Previously, the band had been strenuously against multi-formatting, regarding the practice as a rip-off to fans. However, during the Endless, Nameless period the band released the two singles from the album in multiple formats, including two CD singles with two B-sides on each, and a 7\" single with one B-side, with all the songs from the \"Anthem\" single being cover versions. Many of the band's fans were angry about this practice, with some even handing out fliers against the practice outside Wildhearts shows. Ginger reacted with frustration, saying that they were simply trying to bring more music to the fans. A change in chart eligibility for singles was probably also responsible, as a four-track single (or EP) would no longer be allowed to qualify for the British singles charts, but multiple formats were allowed with a maximum of three tracks or unlimited remixes so long as the running time was under 20 minutes. The band's label may have insisted on these changes as the only way to compete in the singles market of that time.  The band have continued to multi-format since 1997, in particular with \"Top Of The World\" in 2003, consisting of three CD singles, two with two B-sides and one with one B-side and the video for the song. The band have also continued to specifically re-enter the studio to record brand new songs for B-sides. During the band's reformation in the 2001-2004 period, they amassed enough B-sides for Gut Records to release a full-length album consisting only of B-sides, Coupled With.

Primarily a fast bowler, Marshall is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen ever to have played Test cricket. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers, a short man - he stood at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), while most of the great quicks have been well above 6 feet (1.8 m) and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, were 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or above.\nContext: Marshall made his Test debut in the Second Test at Bangalore on 15 December 1978. He immediately developed a career-long antipathy to Dilip Vengsarkar due to his aggressive appealing. Despite doing little of note in the three Tests he played on that tour, he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5-13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League.  Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7-24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8-71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career.  In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US$1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid.

Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music.\n\nAt the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005 with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would be \"featured with\" Queen as \"Queen + Paul Rodgers\", not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating. In November 2004, Queen were among the inaugural inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and the award ceremony was the first event at which Rodgers joined May and Taylor as vocalist.  Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, which was the first time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; \"We never thought we would tour again, Paul [Rodgers] came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\" The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. The Foo Fighters paid homage to the band in performing \"Tie Your Mother Down\" to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Paul Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.  On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a \"secret location\". Queen + Paul Rodgers performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London on 27 June 2008, to commemorate Mandela's ninetieth birthday, and again promote awareness of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The first Queen + Paul Rodgers album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the release of the album, the band again went on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The Kharkiv concert was later released on DVD. The tour then moved to Russia, and the band performed two sold-out shows at the Moscow Arena. Having completed the first leg of its extensive European tour, which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries, the UK leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three London dates, the first of which was The O2 on 13 October. The last leg of the tour took place in South America, and included a sold-out concert at the Estadio Jose Amalfitani, Buenos Aires.  Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009.

In 1968, he won the European Cup with Manchester United, and was named the European Footballer of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year. The Irish Football Association described him as the \"greatest player to ever pull on the green shirt of Northern Ireland\". Born and brought up in Belfast, Best began his club career in England with Manchester United, with the scout who had spotted his talent at the age of 15 sending a telegram to manager Matt Busby which read: \"I think I've found you a genius.\"\n\nBest continued to drink, and was sometimes seen at his local pub in Surbiton, London. On 3 October 2005, he was admitted to intensive care at the private Cromwell Hospital in London, suffering from a kidney infection caused by the side effects of immuno-suppressive drugs used to prevent his body from rejecting his transplanted liver. On 27 October, newspapers stated that Best was close to death and had sent a farewell message to his loved ones. Close friends in the game visited his bedside to make their farewells, including Rodney Marsh, and the two other members of the \"United Trinity\", Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. On 20 November, the British tabloid News of the World published a picture of Best (at his own request) showing him in his hospital bed with jaundice, along with a warning about the dangers of alcohol with his message: \"Don't die like me\". In the early hours of 25 November 2005, treatment was stopped; later that day he died, aged 59, as a result of a lung infection and multiple organ failure.  Tributes were paid to Best from around the world, including from arguably three of the greatest football players ever, Pele, Diego Maradona and Johan Cruyff. Maradona commented: \"George inspired me when I was young. He was flamboyant and exciting and able to inspire his teammates. I actually think we were very similar players - dribblers who were able to create moments of magic.\" Fellow Manchester United legend Eric Cantona gave a eulogy to Best: \"I would love him to save me a place in his team, George Best that is, not God.\"  The Premier League announced that a minute's silence would be observed before all Premier League games to be held over the weekend of his death; however at many grounds a minute's applause broke out in his honour. The first match at Old Trafford after Best's death was a League Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion, the club against which he made his debut for Manchester United in 1963. The match, which United won, was preceded by tributes from former teammate Sir Bobby Charlton. Best's son Calum and former teammates, surviving members from the West Brom team which he played against in his debut, all joined the current United squad on the pitch for a minute's silence, during which fans in every seat held aloft pictures of Best, which were given out before the match.

He also wrote the Beatles' songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\". Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations.\nContext: When Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994.  In 1980, while on the set of the film Caveman, Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has eight grandchildren - one from Zak, four from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.  Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the Sunday Times Rich List 2011, Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of PS150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.  In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \"0000001\". The auction raised over $9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.  In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn't see it going anywhere lately.\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \"get on with\" Brexit, declaring that \"to be in control of your country is a good move.\" CANNOTANSWER\nQuestion: Was he ever re married\n\nAnswer:",

Lecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel Red Dragon as a forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. The novel and its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists after the two serial killers in both novels. In the third novel, Hannibal, Lecter becomes a protagonist.\n\nThroughout the beginning of the second season, Graham, who is now institutionalized, attempts to convince his skeptical former colleagues that Lecter is the real killer and begins pulling strings from within his cell in order to expose him. Meanwhile, Lecter begins to manipulate evidence from the outside, exonerating himself after the FBI's initial investigations into Graham's claims. Eventually, Graham persuades his friend and colleague Beverly Katz (Hetienne Park), a forensic scientist, to investigate Lecter in exchange for help on a case. She breaks into Lecter's house, where she find evidence of his guilt; Lecter catches her, however, and kills her. Angry and vengeful, Graham convinces a deranged hospital orderly (Jonathan Tucker) to try to kill Lecter, but the attempt fails. Lecter retaliates by taking as his lover Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), a psychologist for whom Graham has romantic feelings. Lecter then exonerates Graham by planting forensic evidence of Graham's alleged victims at the scene of one of his own murders, resulting in Graham's release. He also frames his colleague Frederick Chilton (Raul Esparza) by planting a mutilated corpse in his house and \"influencing\" his surviving victim Miriam Lass (Anna Chlumsky), into believing that Chilton had abducted and tortured her.  Graham resumes therapy with Lecter as an attempt to entrap him. Lecter quickly becomes aware of the ruse, but finds the experience fascinating and allows it to continue in order to explore the connection he feels with Graham. In an attempt to push Graham into becoming a serial killer, Lecter sends his psychotic former patient Randall Tier (Mark O'Brien) to kill Graham, but Graham kills and mutilates Tier instead - just as Lecter hoped he would. Later, Graham attacks tabloid reporter Fredericka \"Freddy\" Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki), who is investigating him and Lecter. Graham shares a meal with Lecter of what is implied to be her flesh, but it is soon revealed that Lounds is still alive and conspiring with Graham and Crawford to draw Lecter into their trap.  Lecter and Graham acquire a common enemy in Mason Verger (Michael Pitt), a wealthy sadist whom they both despise for emotionally and sexually abusing his sister Margot (Katharine Isabelle). Verger has them both kidnapped and prepares to feed them to his prize pigs; however, Lecter escapes and takes Verger hostage in Graham's house. He gives Verger a hallucinogenic drug cocktail, and tells him to cut off pieces of his own face and feed them to Graham's dogs. With Graham's tacit approval, Lecter then breaks Verger's neck with his bare hands, paralyzing him.  In the second-season finale, Graham and Crawford move to arrest Lecter against the orders of the FBI. In the ensuing struggle, Lecter seriously wounds Graham and Crawford, while a very much alive Abigail Hobbs pushes Bloom out of a window. Lecter then cuts Abigail's throat in front of Graham and leaves them to die as he flees before the police arrive. He is shown in a post-credits scene aboard a flight to France with his psychiatrist, Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson).

It became the Vandellas' first Top 40 recording, reaching number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaking at number six on the R&B chart. Their second hit, \"Heat Wave\", became a phenomenal record for the group, reaching number four on the Hot 100 and hitting number one on the R&B singles chart for five weeks. It became their first million-seller and eventually got the group their only Grammy Award nomination for Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance. (On the single and album, the song was titled \"Heat Wave\". It was sometime later that the song was retitled to avoid confusion with the Irving Berlin song.)  The group's success continued with their second Top Ten single and third Top 40 single, \"Quicksand\", which was another composition with Holland-Dozier-Holland and reached number eight pop in the late fall of 1963. Around that time, Annette, who was pregnant with her first child and set to get married, chose to leave her singing career behind by 1964. Betty Kelley, formerly of the Velvelettes, was brought in shortly afterward to continue the Vandellas' rise.  The next two singles, \"Live Wire\" and \"In My Lonely Room\" (#6 R&B Cashbox) were less successful singles, failing to reach the Top 40. However, their next single, \"Dancing in the Street\", rose up to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also found global success, peaking at #21 on the UK Singles Chart in 1964. In 1969, \"Dancing in the Street\" was re-issued and it was plugged heavily on radio stations. It did not take long for the song to peak at #4 in the UK, thus making the song one of the all-time favourite Motown single releases ever.

His mother, Annie Satterwhite, was a gifted basketball and track star in high school. His parents never married.\nContext: In May 1972, 41-year-old Mays was traded to the Mets for pitcher Charlie Williams and $50,000 ($292,522 today). At the time, the Giants franchise was losing money. Owner Horace Stoneham could not guarantee Mays a pension after retirement and the Mets offered Mays a coaching position upon his retirement.  Mays had remained popular in New York long after the Giants had left for San Francisco, and the trade was seen as a public relations coup for the Mets. Mets owner Joan Payson, who was a minority shareholder of the Giants when the team was in New York, had long desired to bring Mays back to his baseball roots and was instrumental in making the trade. In his Mets debut on a rainy Sunday afternoon at Shea Stadium on May 14, 1972, Mays put New York ahead to stay with a fifth-inning home run against Don Carrithers and his former team, the Giants. On August 16, 1973 of the following season, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds with Don Gullett on the mound, Mays hit a fourth inning solo home run over the right-center field fence. It was the 660th, and last, home run of his major league career.  Mays played a season and a half with the Mets before retiring; he appeared in 133 games. The Mets honored him on September 25, 1973, (Willie Mays Night) where he thanked the New York fans and said goodbye to baseball. He finished his career in the 1973 World Series, which the Mets lost to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. Mays got the first hit of the Series, but had only seven at-bats (with two hits). The final hit of his career came in Game 2, a key single to help the Mets win. He also fell down in the outfield during a play where he was hindered by the glare of the sun and by the hard outfield. Mays later said, \"growing old is just a helpless hurt.\" His final at bat came on October 16, in Game 3 where he came in as a pinch hitter but grounded into a force play. Mays made his 20th and last All-Star appearance (20 seasons) and 24th All-Star Game appearance on July 24, 1973 when he was used as a pinch hitter.  In 1972 and 1973, Mays was the oldest regular position player in baseball. At age 42, he became the oldest position player to appear in a World Series game. Mays retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 and 660 home runs. His lifetime total of 7,095 outfield putouts remains the major league record.

He is currently Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. Sowell was born in North Carolina, but grew up in Harlem, New York.\n\nSowell is both a syndicated columnist and an academic economist, whose column was distributed by Creators Syndicate. Themes of Sowell's writing range from social policy on race, ethnic groups, education and decision-making, to classical and Marxist economics, to the problems of children perceived as having disabilities.  While often described as a black conservative, he prefers not to be labeled, having stated, \"I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that 'libertarian' would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement on a number of things\". He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.  Sowell also writes on racial topics and is a critic of affirmative action and race-based quotas. On the topic of affirmative action, Sowell has stated it's \"one of the few policies that can be said to harm virtually every group in a different way... Obviously, whites and Asians lose out when you have preferential admission for black students or Hispanic students--but blacks and Hispanics lose out because what typically happens is the students who have all the credentials to succeed in college are admitted to colleges where the standards are so much higher that they fail.\" He takes strong issue with the notion of government as a helper or savior of minorities, arguing that the historical record shows quite the opposite.  Sowell occasionally writes on the subject of gun control, about which he has stated: \"One can cherry-pick the factual studies, or cite some studies that have subsequently been discredited, but the great bulk of the studies show that gun control laws do not in fact control guns.

Nabokov was a self-proclaimed \"White Russian\", and was, from its inception, a strong opponent of the Soviet government that came to power following the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In a poem he wrote as a teenager in 1917, he described Lenin's Bolsheviks as \"grey rag-tag people\".  Throughout his life, Nabokov would remain committed to the classical liberal political philosophy of his father, and equally opposed Tsarist autocracy, communism and fascism.  Nabokov's father Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov was the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II had successfully blocked anti-semitic measures from being passed by the Interior Minister. That family strain would continue in Vladimir Nabokov, who fiercely denounced anti-semitism in his writings, and in the 1930s Nabokov was able to escape Hitler's Germany only with the help of Russian Jewish emigres who still had grateful memories of his family's defense of Jews in Tsarist times.

He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development.\n\nIn 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life.  Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe.  Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

Formerly known as Victoria and Ayesha Castle, she renamed the castle after the house from the book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier. In 2009, during her three-year break from music, Enya purchased a home in southern France.  Since the 1980s, Enya has attracted the attention of several stalkers. In 1996, an Italian man who was seen in Dublin wearing a photograph of Enya around his neck, stabbed himself outside her parents' pub after being ejected from the premises. In 2005, two people broke into her home; one attacked one of her maids and left with several of Enya's items. Enya raised the alarm in her safe room. The incident led Enya to spend roughly PS250,000 on security improvements, covering gaps in the castle's outer wall and installing bollards and iron railings.  Enya is known for keeping a low profile and very private lifestyle, saying: \"The music is what sells. Not me, or what I stand for ... that's the way I've always wanted it\". She is not married and is a surrogate aunt to the Ryans' two daughters. In 1991, she said: \"I'm afraid of marriage because I'm afraid someone might want me because of who I am instead of because they loved me ... I wouldn't go rushing into anything unexpected, but I do think a great deal about this\". Her relationship with a Spanish man ended in 1997, around the time when she considered taking time out of music to have a family, but found she was putting pressure on herself over the matter and \"gone the route I wanted to go\". She declares herself as \"more spiritual than religious ... I derive from religion what I enjoy.\"  In 2006, Enya ranked third in a list of the wealthiest Irish entertainers with an estimated fortune of PS75 million, and No. 95 in the Sunday Times Rich List of the richest 250 Irish people.

Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War.\n\nDavid Monroe Shoup was born on 30 December 1904 in Battle Ground, Indiana. His family lived on a farm in Ash Grove, but moved to Covington to live on a new farm in 1916. At age 12 he was enrolled in Covington High School, a competitive high school with an advanced curriculum. Shoup was an excellent student, maintaining high marks in French, English, physics, and history. Additionally, he was involved in several extracurricular activities, including basketball, and was class president in his senior year. He graduated in 1921. He later affectionately referred to his impoverished upbringing as that of an \"Indiana plowboy.\" Regarded by friends as very sociable, he met Zola De Haven in his freshman year and later said he had been instantly attracted to her. They were both very competitive in academics and athletics, and the two dated throughout high school; they were married in 1931.  After high school, Shoup attended DePauw University where he was one of 100 awarded the Edward Rector Scholarship, giving him full tuition. Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his living expenses, and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military. He graduated from DePauw in 1926.  From an early age, Shoup was molded by the progressive ideas of Indiana politicians, sympathizing with rural progressives fighting against the interests of big businesses. He developed an anti-imperialist attitude, and his skepticism about American foreign policy, influenced by his small-town background, made him an outspoken opponent of the unnecessary use of military force. He felt the use of troops for economic or imperialist consideration was wrong, a viewpoint he would carry for his entire career.

His father's (Ai Qing) original surname was written Jiang (Jiang ). Ai collaborated with Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron as the artistic consultant on the Beijing National Stadium for the 2008 Olympics.\nContext: In June 2011, the Beijing Local Taxation Bureau demanded a total of over 12 million yuan (US$1.85 million) from Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. in unpaid taxes and fines, and accorded three days to appeal the demand in writing. According to Ai's wife, Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. has hired two Beijing lawyers as defense attorneys. Ai's family state that Ai is \"neither the chief executive nor the legal representative of the design company, which is registered in his wife's name.\"  Offers of donations poured in from Ai's fans across the world when the fine was announced. Eventually an online loan campaign was initiated on 4 November 2011, and close to 9 million RMB was collected within ten days, from 30,000 contributions. Notes were folded into paper planes and thrown over the studio walls, and donations were made in symbolic amounts such as 8964 (4 June 1989, Tiananmen Massacre) or 512 (12 May 2008, Sichuan earthquake). To thank creditors and acknowledge the contributions as loans, Ai designed and issued loan receipts to all who participated in the campaign. Funds raised from the campaign were used as collateral, required by law for an appeal on the tax case. Lawyers acting for Ai submitted an appeal against the fine in January 2012; the Chinese government subsequently agreed to conduct a review.  In June 2012, the court heard the tax appeal case. Ai's wife, Lu Qing, the legal representative of the design company, attended the hearing. Lu was accompanied by several lawyers and an accountant, but the witnesses they had requested to testify, including Ai, were prevented from attending a court hearing. Ai asserts that the entire matter - including the 81 days he spent in jail in 2011 - is intended to suppress his provocations. Ai said he had no illusions as to how the case would turn out, as he believes the court will protect the government's own interests. On 20 June, hundreds of Ai's supporters gathered outside the Chaoyang District Court in Beijing despite a small army of police officers, some of whom videotaped the crowd and led several people away. On 20 July, Ai's tax appeal was rejected in court. The same day Ai's studio released \"The Fake Case\" which tracks the status and history of this case including a timeline and the release of official documents. On 27 September, the court upheld the 2.4 million tax evasion fine. Ai had previously deposited 1.33 million in a government-controlled account in order to appeal. Ai said he will not pay the remainder because he does not recognize the charge.  In October 2012, authorities revoked the license of Beijing Fa Ke Cultural Development Ltd. for failing to re-register, an annual requirement by the administration. The company was not able to complete this procedure as its materials and stamps were confiscated by the government. CANNOTANSWER\nQuestion: What was the tax case?. Whats the answer?",

Their first organized gig was a talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots. In 1992, they dropped the \"Square\" because a local folk group had claim to the name.  Organix was the band's first album, released and sold independently in 1993. It drew offers from music labels, and the band signed with DGC/Geffen. The Roots' first album for DGC, Do You Want More?!!!??!, was released in 1994. It was a moderate hit among alternative music fans, boosted by the group's appearance at Lollapalooza. The band performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival that year. Touring guests, beatboxer Rahzel and producer Scott Storch, joined The Roots.  The 1996 release Illadelph Halflife was the group's first album to break the Top 40 on the Billboard 200 chart, spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for \"What They Do\" (a parody of rap video cliches) and \"Clones\", which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts. \"What They Do\" was also the group's first single to hit the Top 40 of Billboard's charts, reaching a peak of #34.

Find out if other friends are going and ask what their plans are. They may want to travel together, have dinner beforehand, or make other plans with you.  If the party has an online invitation, you may be able to see who’s been invited and who’s going. Be sensitive when asking if a friend is going. Remember that they may not have been invited and might not even know about the party. Some parties are small and by invitation only. However, some parties are given with the idea that the more people come, the more fun the party will be. If the party is open to all, ask a friend or two if they’d like to join you.  With more intimate parties, hosts often expect that invited guests will bring one person who is their date. Check with the host if this is the case, and invite a date to come with you if appropriate. If you’re not sure whether it’s okay to invite others to the party, ask the host. Let your friend know what to expect. For example, if the party has a theme or a dress code, make sure your friend knows so that they can dress appropriately. You need to know how you’ll get to and from the party. If you plan to drink alcohol at the party, this is especially important, since you’ll want to have a designated driver or a plan that includes public transportation, a cab, or another safe means of getting home.  Ask your friends about their plans. Does one of them want to be the designated driver? Do they live within walking distance of the party? If so, maybe you could crash on their couch afterward. Red the public transportation schedule if you plan to use it. If the party goes late, make sure that you’ll still be able to make the last bus or train. Keep the phone number for a taxi service with you in case you end up needing it. Check with your friends before the party whether or not you’ll leave together.

The therapist can encourage both parties to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the relationship. If patterns emerge, such as patterns of infidelity or emotional abuse, the therapist can address them. If you feel you’re to blame for the affair, the therapist can help you to work through those problems. You may have feelings of inadequacy, or betrayal or anger and the therapist can help you  to deal with them. The partner who had the affair may need to work through feeling of regret, or may even need to know why they felt it necessary to have an affair. Here,too, the therapist can help. The partner who cheated may need to work on communicating dissatisfaction with the relationship so that the temptation of infidelity (or an excuse for it) can be avoided. Be specific. The more specific you are, the more tangible will be the changes that you both make to help your relationship go forward.  Do you need certain times each week, an hour or so, in which you discuss problems that have cropped up between you? Do you need more physical attention, more affection? Do you need more romance? Do you need something simple, like going to bed at the same time each night? Keep in mind that you’re “resetting the clock.” This is a chance to start over, using your prior experiences to inform the way you define and maintain your relationship. Why did your partner think your relationship wasn’t working?  This will probably be difficult since your partner was the one who had the affair.  You may not be feeling in an especially generous and giving mood. Remind yourself that you’re addressing an underlying problem by finding out just what your partner thinks can be improved. You're working to avoid another affair. As time passes, the discussions about the details of the affair will become less frequent. They should.  You don’t want the affair to be what your relationship is about. When you find it's no longer urgent for you to talk about the affair, set aside specific times for discussing it so that the affair won’t overwhelm the relationship. Enjoy each other’s company by revisiting the types of things that you used to do together that you enjoyed.  Put fun and friendship back into your relationship by revisiting activities that once made you feel close. Add new activities so that your relationship will feel authentic and not contrived. Movies, long drives, nature walks, dinner out, visiting friends . . . what were the things you did together that made you feel closer? Make a date night once a week a regular routine. Talk about the present rather than the past when you’re on your date, so that you can go forward and reinvigorate your relationship.  Don’t let the affair define your relationship.  You'll always be aware that your partner was unfaithful to you.  But lack of trust can't be the basis for a healthy rebuilt relationship. Most affairs are preceded by problems with communicating. Misunderstandings occur and feelings get hurt. Avoid these problems by communicating routinely.  Share your daily experiences. It’s not necessary to give a blow-by-blow account.  But keep in touch with each other’s lives and thoughts by communicating. Listen to your partner.  Show you care about their experiences, thoughts, feelings. It takes time. There are stages you’ll go through, from the initial crisis, to a loss of belief in your relationship, to slowly coming to trust your partner again.  It could take six months to rebuild trust in the relationship.  It could take two years. It's up to you to decide how much time and effort to put in.

If you’re letting go of the man because he turned you down, then you need to be firm to yourself about the fact that it’s really over. If you told him you’d like to end the relationship, then it’s important to tell him as firmly as possible, so he has no doubts about the end of the relationship. Don’t be embarrassed about feeling sad and work on letting all of those sad, angry, confused, or bitter feelings out. Cry as much as you need to, whether you’re alone at home or talking to a friend. Write all of your feelings down. Accept that you may need to be by yourself for a few days. Do whatever you can to get those feelings out on the surface, so you can begin to accept them and deal with them. The longer you keep them bottled up, the harder it will be to let go of the man you love.  Nothing is too sappy or too ridiculous. If you want to watch a romantic comedy and cry your eyes out, put on Love Actually and go for it. If you want to sing “Let it Go” at the top of your lungs, no one is stopping you.  This is your time to deal with your break-up, and you can let your feelings out however you want. If you find that you can’t cry, that’s okay too. If you’d rather punch a pillow, no one is stopping you. Don’t expect to be running around with your friends, having an amazing time with a martini in your hand, the weekend after you have to let go of the man you love. It can take months, or even longer, for you to be ready to really have fun again, and you shouldn’t put pressure on yourself to be “okay” right away. Though it’s probably a good idea to stop wallowing after a few days and to spend some time outdoors or with other people, you shouldn’t feel like you’re forcing yourself to put on a happy face too soon.  Every woman has her own timeline. The pain you feel will depend on your way of dealing with things, as well as the seriousness of your relationship. Don’t feel like you have to be “fine” after a week just because that’s what your friends expect. Don’t force yourself to be social if you really don’t feel like it. There’s nothing worse than going to a big party when all you want to do is cry. That said, you should try to seek one-on-one hangouts with your friends so you feel less alone. One of the best ways to let go of the man you love is to stop talking to him, stop looking at him, and stop hearing his voice. If you have the luxury of cutting off all contact with him, then you should try to do so as soon as possible. Delete his number from your phone, avoid him on social media, and don’t have any awkward coffee dates until you’re really ready to just see him as a friend. If he keeps reaching out to you, make it clear that this is not what you need.  If you know you have to see him in places like school or work, then you don’t have to ignore him completely if that will make things awkward, but you shouldn’t feel obligated to make small talk with him, either. Though you may be desperate to see him or to hear his voice, remember that this will only make things worse, in the end. Though you may be feeling desperate to keep spending time with him, or even to get back together with him, you have to remind yourself of the pain you’d feel if you had to go back to him. Think of how horrible he made you feel, of all the nights he made you cry into your pillow, or all of the pointless fights that made you so angry. It’s easy to only remember the good times, but you should focus on the bad times if you want to let go.  Any time you’re tempted to call the guy or to see what he’s been up to, just think of yourself during the worst day of your relationship. Remember all the pain you felt, and think of how awful it would be to feel even a fraction of that pain again. Of course, you don’t have to make a habit of remembering all the bad times every day, if it makes you feel worse. But if you find yourself pining for your man, then it may be the best thing you can do to keep a level head. You may feel angry, sad, confused, and upset at yourself about the fact that you’re still thinking about this man. You may ask, “What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I get over him already?” but you have to avoid this kind of thinking. There’s no sense in being angry at yourself for what you’re feeling and you have to let nature take its course. There’s nothing wrong in having deep feelings, and being mad about them will only make things worse.  Of course, by making an effort to let go of the man you love, you’ll be moving the process along more quickly than you would if you were pining away in your room. But it’s important to remember that it still takes time to heal.

Either have your vet tech or cat groomer cut them, or ask them to show you how to do it. Clip the tips once a month.  Also brush your cat wherever it lets you. It may even roll around and let you brush its furry stomach if it's in a really affectionate mood! Brushing your cat is not usually necessary to keeping your cat's coat in good condition (cats usually groom themselves) but it is a good way to form a bond with your pet. This is also a chance for you to inspect your cat's coat and its body for potential health issues. Look for black dots or things moving in the cat's fur. Separate the fur and look at the exposed skin. If you do see things moving or lots of small black dots (flea feces), get it a flea and tick collar, a spray, powder, or take the cat to the vet to get suggestions about treatment. Sometimes as cats get older they are no longer able to groom their coats completely. They loose flexibility, making it impossible for them to reach their entire coat. If this is the case with your cat, you may need to do more regular grooming to keep your cat's coat healthy. Unneutered animals are much more territorial and likely to mark their territory (your home!) with urine or feces. Also, they are more likely to attract strays to the house, which in turn can leave your cat feeling threatened or distressed by the sight of other cats in its yard. Even though the cat doesn't go out, you should still get it vaccinated. Some viral infections, such as feline distemper, are caused by hardy viruses that can be walked in on your shoes. Also, if your cat does slip out one dark night, because its immune system has never been exposed to outdoor bugs, there is a greater risk of it catching disease. Cats that don't hunt or go outdoors still require worming twice a year. This is because they are born with worms that they acquired from their mother, and the worm eggs lay dormant in the body tissues which hatch out over the pet's lifetime. While the risk of acquiring fleas is lower with an indoor cat, if your pet does pick up a flea than you are liable to have a population explosion.

Many doctors will write you a prescription for this fairly readily, as it is not a controlled substance and has few negative side effects in adults. Ask for a 100 mL vial. Viscous lidocaine is also fairly cheap and covered by most insurance plans.  Get your prescription filled by a pharmacist. Lidocaine will reduce the feeling in your mouth, possibly making it difficult to chew, so avoid eating for at least one hour after using the drug. Lidocaine may not be safe for children under age 3, so make sure to keep the contain tightly closed and stored where children cannot access it. The common brand name for the first medication is Benadryl. You can find this easily at drug stores and it is often available in a generic or store brand.

Once you’ve done this, the mouthwash is ready to use. Be sure to follow your doctor’s advice on dosage. Since this medication is used to treat a wide variety of conditions, your physician will give your instructions based on the specific treatment you are seeking.

ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to 10 credits, and portfolio transactions of 10 credits and more. Eighty-three member firms supplied data for the survey. Interest rate and currency derivatives growth clocked in at just above 3.5% in the first half of the year among members that also reported at year-end 2000, ISDA said. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes increased to about US$55.2trn from roughly US$53.3trn. Total notional principal of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and currency swaps for all surveyed firms slid to US$57.3trn from US$G3trn at year-end last year. Among the top 10 dealers, a minor decrease in volume from US$35.6trn to US$35.Strn was recorded, ISDA noted. According to Thomas Montag, chair of ISDA's market survey committee, the shifting product use reflected greater uncertainty in the global market environment. \"The market for credit protection has an obvious appeal during times of economic downturn,\" he added. ISDA's survey is compiled twice a year by Andersen. Sixty-seven of the 83 member firms that participated in this survey also participated in the previous survey. ISDA's new supplement includes converts in default swaps Dow Jones - November 12, 2001 By Joe Niedzielski  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has published a supplement to its 1999 document for credit derivatives which incorporates convertible bonds and zero-coupon bonds, among others, as deliverable securities in these contracts. The trade group said late Friday that it had finalized and published its Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations. The supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and exchangeable obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations, such as zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and non-discounted bonds that accrete during their term, ISDA said. \"The Convertibles Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio managers, credit protection sellers and dealers,\" said Robert G. Pickel, ISDA's executive director and CEO. Credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default on obligations like bonds or loans, or other types of credit events like a debt restructuring. They have had a growing influence in the broader fixed-income universe, at times playing a role in the pricing of corporate bonds. And some convertible-bond investors will lay off the credit risk from the fixed-income portion of a convertible security by buying credit default swap protection. ISDA's supplement was expected. A group of U.S.-based dealers submitted a proposal to ISDA a few months ago to include obligations like convertible bonds as deliverable securities in these contracts. And in mid-October, ISDA told members that convertible bonds were deliverable under standard credit derivatives contracts. The group's memorandum to members came in response to questions from members following the appointment of a railway administrator for Railtrack PLC (U.RTK). Holders of convertible bonds issued by Railtrack had complained that some sellers of credit protection weren't paying claims on default swap contracts on the Railtrack credit. The Basel perplex The Economist - November 8, 2001  The arcane world of banking supervision is not usually the talk of German chancellors on tours of Asia. Gerhard Schr?der made an exception recently when he threatened that Germany would veto any new European directive based on the latest proposals from the Basel committee of big-country bank supervisors. In its present form, said Mr Schr?der in Bangalore, Basel 2 (as the proposals are known) is \"unacceptable to Germany\". Basel 2 attempts to formulate more precisely than before the levels of \"regulatory\" capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit and other risks that they run. After more than three years of talks, the Basel boffins have developed rules which are still not acceptable to commercial banks. That is strange, since they are supposed to mirror the way the world's most sophisticated banks themselves calculate their risks. The whole exercise has shades of Heath Robinson about it. The banks are up in arms, this week bearding the Basel committee for its latest draft rules, which get ever more complicated and prescriptive. By the time they are implemented, in 2005 at the earliest, the rules look likely to burden banks with extra costs (ie, through the need to run parallel reporting systems) and perverse incentives to \"game\" the system. Basel 2 could thus aggravate the very thing it set out to correct, a distortion of financial markets. Germany's grouse has to do with the Mittelstand, the 3m small and medium-sized companies that are the economy's backbone. The Basel 2 formulae for credit risk are based on credit ratings applied to company debt, either by rating agencies or internally by banks themselves. But few smaller companies are rated in this way. Moreover, German companies are more than usually dependent on medium-term bank loans, and the longer the loan the more it is penalised under the proposals. The Germans-but also the Italians and the Japanese-fear that their medium-sized companies will lose under the new capital regime. Many of the 2,800 German banks are not equipped to rate the companies to which they lend: equipping them would drive up the cost of lending. German bank associations plan to help by pooling credit data for their members. But Mr Schr?der's advice to banks last week was that they should not be overhasty in applying the new Basel principles ahead of time. Already the committee is working on a fix. On November 5th it posted a clutch of new suggestions on its website that included new risk weightings for smaller companies, and proposals that physical collateral, receivables and even leased assets be used to lessen a particular company's credit charge. These were interim ideas, it said, which needed to be tested and even revised. All well and good. But the Basel committee is getting into knots trying to address every objection as it arises. Each time, it seems, the committee adds another layer of complexity for banks and their supervisors to master. Most recently, after strident objections by banks, there was the shifting of the \"w-factor\" (the possibly unquantifiable residual risk in a credit derivative) from one supervisory category to another, and also the setting of arbitrary minimum risk weights for unrated securitised assets. The figure for operational risk (non-market risks such as the loss of data, a rogue trader or the destruction of a bank's headquarters) has been slashed, after objections from banks. The November 5th pabulum came in response to a \"quantitative impact study\" (a live study of how the proposed capital charges would affect a sample of 138 banks in 25 countries). The Basel committee has always said that the scale of charges needs to be properly calibrated. In fact, it gave itself an extra year to get the calibration right. It has invited some banks to take part in a fresh impact study using its latest proposed adjustments. The results should help the Basel committee to tweak its formulae to get results. Its declared goal is not to increase or decrease the overall capital charge imposed on the banking system, merely to allocate it more efficiently. But some regulators are worried that the more risk-sensitive the regime is, the more reluctant banks will be to lend in a downturn, aggravating economic cycles. There are attempts to fix this too. For example, Spain allows its banks to make a provision at the inception of a loan-putting money aside for a rainy day. Some countries need to fix their accounting regimes before they can follow suit. Regulators appear stoically optimistic that all these fixes will work, and that a credible new framework will be established-not without flaws, perhaps, but better than what exists today. The timetable may slip, but the plan is to produce a final draft framework early next year, allowing consultation until the end of March, which should result in a firm set of rules by the end of 2002. That, in theory, still allows time for the European Union to draft and finalise a matching directive on capital adequacy for banks and financial firms, to be in force by January 2005. With Basel 2, bank supervisors are trying to do three main things. They want to devise formulae that bring capital charges closer to the banks' own measures of risk. They want to establish continuous review of banks' management, and especially of their risk management, as a factor in adjusting the capital charge. And they want to create incentives for greater public disclosure of banks' risk exposures. This is an attempt to let markets take on more of a supervisory role. Yet, in reality, the supervisors are becoming micro-managers. A member of the Basel committee insists that most of the world's 36,000 banks will be governed by a regime no more complex than Basel 1, in force today. The more sophisticated financial groups that aspire to a so-called \"advanced\" approach will be treated differently. \"We'll be crawling all over them initially,\" says the supervisor, \"because ultimately we're giving them more freedom.\" All the same, in between the lowest and the highest, thousands of banks will be graduating from a standardised to a more sophisticated approach, with heavy demands on supervisors' time. Only America and Britain already have a culture of continuous review by supervisors. Most other regimes are either less sophisticated, or they are hamstrung by non-adjustable capital charges that are set at a minimum by law. Then there is the Brussels hurdle. Whatever the Basel committee decides works for banks must be applied in the European Union to all investment firms, including broker-dealers and asset managers. The scope is huge for further descent into mind-boggling detail. Supervisors and financial firms may well end up thanking Mr Schr?der if he vetoed the lot. Supervisors review cross-sectoral practice IFR - November 10, 2001  The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors last week released, under the banner of the Joint Forum, two reports comparing risk management practices and principles in the sectors they supervise. Both reports were principally aimed at the supervision of conglomerates that incorporate businesses in banking, securities and insurance, but one also took a close look at risk transfer practices. The first report, Risk Management Practices and Regulatory Capital, compared the approaches in each sector in an effort to \"gain a better understanding of current industry practices in all three sectors\". The main sections of the report focus on: differences in core business activities, similarities and differences in risk management tools, approaches to capital regulation in the three sectors and cross-sectoral risk transfers and investments. It is in relation to the latter two sections that the report provided what some may regard as its sting. The Joint Forum suggested that as supervisors evaluate the extent of cross-sectoral activity, in terms of risk transfer using derivatives, securitisation and other techniques: \"It may become important for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to better reflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to those frameworks. It would not be surprising, for example, for some jurisdictions in the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks applied to the different sectors.\" The report explained that supervisors should consider the potential for existing capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage. \"To the extent that some firms are engaging in activities that are not addressed through capital requirements, supervisors need to ensure that other measures are in place to ensure that the associated risks are being appropriately managed and are supported by sufficient economic capital,\" it added. As a result, the report said, supervisors should continue to evaluate approaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments within the various capital frameworks. The second report, Core Principles, compared the core principles each supervisor has issued to its respective sector as risk management guidelines. The Joint Forum found that each set of core principles provided an overview of the essential elements of the supervisory regime in that sector at the time they were written (1997-2000). However, the pace of developments in the financial sector since then has required consideration of the need to keep the core principles updated. The report found no evidence of underlying conflict or contradiction between the three sets of core principles at the highest levels. However, in some cases there are significant differences in the application of similar principles. **End of ISDA Press Report for November 13, 2001**  THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's driver was arrested after being caught stealing the Oscar-winning composer's housekeeping cash.

The chauffeur, who was wearing a bright purple tie and navy-blue jacket as he was taken to the police car, has now been sacked, according to Lord Lloyd-Webber's company, Really Useful Group. He was arrested on suspicion of 'theft employee' and taken to a nearby police station where he admitted the offence and accepted a caution. A source told The Sun that hundreds of pounds had gone missing from the composer's mansion in recent weeks. Lord Lloyd-Webber, the theatre impresario behind musicals including Cats and Evita, is worth an estimated £640million and was ranked 162 in The Sunday Times' Rich List last year. His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical, as pre-tax profits of Really Useful Investments were raised to £6.2million  to June 2014. The composer's revival of Cats, the musical, starring Nicole Scherzinger is set to extend its West End run with 100,000 extra tickets after 'extraordinary' demand from a new generation of fans.

His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical. The composer told the Sunday Times he was advised that he was being 'almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films', adding: 'At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.' He lives in his Belgravia townhouse with his third wife, Madeleine Gurdon, a former equestrian sportswoman. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to reports of a theft at an address in SW1 at 1.20pm on Thursday 5 February. 'A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft employee and was taken into police custody. He was cautioned and there will not be a court appearance.'

Constance Rimmer was left suffering black eyes and a badly bruised forehead for weeks allegedly after her altercation with Arti Fact. The 84-year-old told Liverpool crown court she was hanging out a tea towel on the communal lawn she shared with Arti Fact while he was drinking whiskey at 5pm on March 26. Black and blue: Constance Rimmer suffered huge bruises to her face and claims her 'neighbour headbutted' her. She said: 'He has a lovely little dog. It came across to me and I was stroking it. 'He said \"leave my f-ing dog alone\", but he said the full word. He bellowed it at me.' She then described how she retreated to her door as bearded Fact, born Richard John Bailey, followed her while still shrieking at her. Arti Fact is accused of attacking his 84-year-old neighbour because she stroked his dog. She said: 'He’s such a big gentleman. I put my hand out and got an umbrella from the stand. He said hit me hit me hit me. 'I managed not to. I just poked him with my umbrella that was when he head butted me.' Fact, 46, of Southport, denied assault and branded Mrs Rimmer, who was left with appalling injuries, a 'nasty woman and a liar'. He said she had probably hit herself with her umbrella during the altercation.

She said: 'You are a violent person and have been violent in the past.' Fact, who has two hearing aids and uses a mobility scooter, replied: 'I have defended myself.'

According to NBC, Ms Colbert came across Farmer taking the disturbing, explicit images of the child at her apartment. He then allegedly killed his cousin and her foster daughter. Detectives said they discovered pornographic photos of the 10-year-old on Farmer's cellphone. The child was allegedly forced to engage in a 'prohibited sexual act' while the photographs were taken. Farmer also took part in sexual acts with the child, police said. He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder along with other endangerment charges.

The boob tube. \"57 Channels (and Nothin' On).\" \"Kill your television\" says the bumper sticker. In 1961, it was famously deemed a \"vast wasteland.\" After all, there were just three TV networks at the time. Most major cities didn't have public television stations (PBS was still years away). And the UHF band, where independent stations would later flourish, was barely used. The first communications satellite didn't go up until 1962. And the content? With few exceptions, the networks carried mostly dumbed-down, formulaic cop shows, Westerns, situation comedies and musical-variety programs. News was something people got from newspapers. \"It was a very limited choice,\" says Newton Minow, the former Federal Communications Commission chairman who coined the \"vast wasteland\" phrase in his 1961 speech to the National Association of Broadcasters and has heard it repeated regularly over the last five decades. Times have changed, right? Actually, yes, says TV critic Eric Deggans. Of the many flaws of '60s entertainment TV, he says, a major one was that it didn't reflect what was going on in America, whether it was the civil rights movement or the escalation of the Vietnam War. \"Back then, there was a lot of TV that was created by producers who really underestimated the audience,\" Deggans says. New Day: 5 things Dick Cavett misses about '60s TV (including: No Kardashians) As the decade continued, television gingerly addressed some social change but certainly nothing like what was to come -- first in the 1970s with such Norman Lear sitcoms as \"All in the Family\" and \"Sanford and Son\" and in more recent years, novelistic shows such as \"Breaking Bad.\" TV: The new, new golden age. In fact, Deggans says even today's widely popular sitcoms and dramas, such as \"Parenthood,\" engage with real life in ways that were forbidden 50 years ago. That's true even with \"The Walking Dead,\" an end-of-the-world horror show about zombies. \"What it's really about is man's inhumanity to man, and when something happens and all the chips are down, how do you respond as a human being?\" he says, referring to \"The Walking Dead.\" \"When you think about what's going on in Nigeria or the Arab Spring or Syria, that's real life.\" Moreover, even the more formulaic shows don't take their viewers for granted. \"I don't think any of those shows pander to their audience in the way that a show like 'Petticoat Junction' or 'Gilligan's Island' did,\" he says. \"Those were classic comedies, but they were really, really simple. A show like 'NCIS' is absolutely about all these issues we're struggling with as a society.\" Ironically, Minow's 1961 speech was somewhat taken out of context. He actually praised the medium before lowering the boom: \"When television is good, nothing -- not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers -- nothing is better,\" he said. His concern that TV wasn't properly serving the public is what prompted his criticism. Indeed, the speech was titled \"Television in the Public Interest.\" The last half-century has been mostly positive, says Minow today -- and he observes that the federal government played a positive role in that growth. Minow, now 88 and an attorney in Chicago, was instrumental in requiring television sets to include a UHF dial and promoting the use of communications satellites. \"I felt that the basic role of the government was to expand choice, because the government should not be in the business of deciding what's on the air,\" he says. \"I think the expansion of choice was the government's main contribution.\" He does have some concerns, however, about the increasing consolidation of the communications industry over the last 50 years. \"I think the idea of having local ownership has pretty much disappeared,\" he says. But he shrugs, \"The horse is out of the barn.\" Massive mergers planned for TV providers. Deggans notes, however, that despite the corporatization of media, there's still a much broader range than in the '60s -- or even in the '90s. After all, 50 years ago we had three networks. Now there's cable, the Internet is a major player allowing for video streaming, and technology lets anybody \"broadcast themselves,\" to borrow YouTube's old slogan. They can choose when to watch, too. Yes, TV is still belittled. But the argument flows both ways. After his speech, Minow was tweaked by \"Gilligan's Island\" producer Sherwood Schwartz, who made the FCC chairman the namesake of a certain shipwrecked boat. Minow appreciated the gesture. \"I told him I considered it a great compliment,\" he says. \"It exposed my name to two generations of television viewers.\""

Growing change: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson wants rules relaxed on GM crops for UK farmers. UK ministers want the European Union to relax restrictions on the cultivation of genetically-modified crops. Owen Paterson wants to make it easier for farmers to grow GM plants for human consumption, even though critics lambast the idea as ‘Frankenscience’. In a speech next week, the Environment Secretary is expected to cite growing scientific evidence that GM foods are safe, as well as surveys showing a relaxation of the rules would be supported by the majority of farmers. Mr Paterson will say there is a need for a new approach to GM to ensure Britain ‘is not left behind’ in agricultural science. However, any such move will be in the teeth of much opposition. A survey by YouGov out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology, while 35 per cent opposed it. Yesterday science minister David Willetts supported calls for controls on GM crops to be weakened. ‘We believe GM crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable, by, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels,’ he said. Whitehall sources told the Independent newspaper that ministers are increasingly concerned that the potential moral and ethical benefits of GM are being ignored by costly and bureaucratic licensing regulations. A twelfth of global arable land is under GM cultivation, and ministers fear Britain – the birthplace of the 18th century agrarian revolution that modernised the world – faces being left behind. GM crops can be engineered to grow faster, increase their resistance to weeds, pests and pesticides, produce extra nutrients or survive harsher weather. But while they are widely grown in the Americas, they are effectively banned in the UK and Europe where they are considered on an extremely strict case-by-case basis. Ministers argue that GM technology has. the potential to improve crop yields, help the agricultural industry and. provide benefits to human health through vitamin fortification. It. could also help combat diseases such as ash dieback and help in the. development of new medicines. Genetically improved? Minsters believe GM crops could 'make agriculture more efficient' and help eradicate diseases such as dieback in the UK. A source told the Independent: ‘The point about GM is not simply about food production. ‘There are wider potential environmental and economic benefits to the technology both in the UK and internationally. ‘What we want to do is start a dialogue within Europe on GM, based upon the science.’ Mr Paterson wants to build support in Brussels for a relaxation of GM rules and hopes powerful Germany will come on side. But others will be opposed. In April, Poland became the eighth EU member state to ban the cultivation of GM crops. A poll of more than 600 British farmers found a considerable shift in their stance toward GM over the past year. Nearly a third said they would be more likely to grow the crops now than they were a year ago. Martin Haworth of the National Farmers’ Union said: ‘Farmers are becoming more and more aware that climate change doesn’t mean a gradual rise in temperatures but rather a stream of extreme weather events. GM technology is one possible way of mitigating this.’\nHere is a summary of the highlights for this article:",

The bill was passed by the upper house of India's Parliament today - two days after the lower house approved it. The law was hurried through Parliament after the gang rape on a young woman on December 16 sparked nationwide protests demanding the government do more to safeguard women. Passed: The parliament building in New Delhi, where the new rape legislation was voted through today. The government set up a panel headed by a retired judge, which recommended sweeping changes to India's laws governing crimes against women. The Cabinet quickly passed an ordinance incorporating some of those suggestions, but Parliament had to pass a new law by next month or the ordinance would have expired. The protection of women in India also came under the spotlight when a Swiss tourists was raped while camping with her husband in Datia district last week. In a separate incident this week, a hotel manager has been accused of attempting to rape a British holidaymaker in the northern city of Agra. Outrage: The brutal attack at the end of last year sent shock waves across India."

                "targets": "Nine small earthquakes rattled North Texas just hours apart on Tuesday, though no damage has so far been reported from the temblors. The magnitudes of the earthquakes, which began around 7.30am, ranged from 1.6 to 3.6, according to the USGS. Earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel. The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb. At least two of those could be felt throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Seismologists also installed a new earthquake-monitoring device in Irving this week, after minor temblors rocked an area which is near the site of the former Dallas Cowboys football stadium. Scroll down for video. Map: The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb in North Texas. The first quake at 3:10 p.m. measured 3.5 in magnitude. Another at about 7 p.m. measured 3.6, while tremors at 8:11 p.m. and 8:12 p.m. measured less than 3.0. The first four happened within an area near the Trinity River that's seen a swarm of mild temblors in recent months. USGS geophysicist Jana Pursley says Tuesday's quakes were the 'largest since the earthquakes started happening there in the last year.' According to NBC DFW, a 1.7 earthquake took place close to a Dallas intersection at 9:54pm, and a 2.4 earthquake hit Irving's University of Dallas campus  at 10:05pm. A 1.6 earthquake struck at 11:02pm - and like many of the other quakes, was also in the vicinity of the Trinity River, the affiliate station reported. Carrieann Bedwell, a geophysicist with the USGS in Golden, Colorado, said senior scientists would be investigating the temblors. 'They will be looking at the parameters, magnitude, depth, location of each of the events,' Bedwell said Wednesday. 'Right now we're calling it a swarm, because we've had multitude events happen.' The seismic series has left residents on edge, wondering if the situation will get worse and what has been behind an uptick in quakes over the last several years. 'The safety and security of our residents is paramount for the city of Irving,' said Irving City Manager Chris Hillman. Some residents believe the implosion of Texas Stadium in 2010 may have exacerbated problems. There is also speculation the quakes might be related to hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking,' an energy extraction technique that has a long history in north Texas. Trouble: Some residents believe the implosion of Texas Stadium in 2010 may have exacerbated problems with earthquakes in the area. Irving, headquarters of Exxon Mobil's XTO unit that helped pioneer hydraulic fracturing in the region, has two gas wells that were fracked in 2010, according to city officials. The Irving area, with a population topping 250,000, has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early September, according to Brian Stump, a seismologist with Southern Methodist University. 'SMU's seismology team is committed to helping North Texans understand more about the increasing number of earthquakes felt in our region over the last few years, most recently near the city of Irving,' Stump said in a statement Tuesday. SMU researchers installed a seismometer in Irving on Monday. Other devices were set up earlier near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and on the Dallas campus. The study is aimed at pinpointing the quakes' epicenters, Stump said. About 40 miles west of Irving, a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of Azle a year ago, causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations. Residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending. Energy industry officials have said fracking is safe and causes no significant seismic damage."

Gemma Porteous, 22, the girlfriend of Cowdenbeath FC player Dean Brett, died of spinal cancer on Tuesday. She was diagnosed with cancer shortly after giving birth to twins Mollie and Mia three months early on June 2. Gemma Porteous, 22, the girlfriend of Cowdenbeath FC player Dean Brett, died of spine cancer, only months after her premature baby daughter, Mollie, passed away. Mr Brett, who lives in Tranent, East Lothian, posted a heartbreaking message on Facebook informing family and friends of his loss. He wrote: 'For the people who don't know, Gemma passed away earlier today, sorry to tell it like this but it's easier! 'I just really want to say how proud I am of my best friend and that I will always love her! Thanks for a brilliant 6 years, 2 amazing daughters and everything you have done for me!! 'I miss you already but I know you will be having fun with Mollie.. Sweet dreams Gem and I promise I will take good care of Mia xxxxxx.' He later wrote on Twitter:  'Thanks to everyone for your support! Means a lot to me to have so many people who care! I'll be back to making awful jokes in no time.' Mr Brett paid tribute to his girlfriend on Twitter - the 22-year-old died of spinal cancer on Tuesday. On Facebook, he said: 'I just really want to say how proud I am of my best friend and that I will always love her! Thanks for a brilliant 6 years, 2 amazing daughters and everything you have done for me!!' On Twitter, Mr Brett thanked his friends for their messages for the support following the loss of his girlfriend. It is understood Ms Porteous was told she had cancer and started treatment weeks after daughter Mollie passed away. Baby Mia was born at 1.30am on June 2 and weighed just 3lbs while Mollie was born twenty minutes later at 1.50am weighing just under 2lb. The tot struggled to gain weight and died after falling sick. Last night, Alex Anderson, secretary of the Scottish Championship club said everyone at Cowdenbeath would help Mr Brett cope with his double loss. Mr Anderson said: 'There is not a lot anyone can say which will be of much comfort to the laddie, apart from telling him that he is part of the Cowdenbeath family and as one of ours we will do everything we can to support him. 'Dean has been off on compassionate leave for the last few months.

Mel B admitted having an argument with her husband Stephen Belafonte in an interview with gossip magazine Grazia published online last night. The husband of Mel B yesterday vehemently rejected claims he might be responsible for apparent marks on her face and body. The former Spice Girl provoked fevered speculation after she returned to The X Factor on Sunday with what appeared to be scratches and a bruised cheek. The judge came back for the final after being admitted to hospital on Thursday but there was no explanation for her absence. Viewers took to Twitter to make comments about the mysterious marks, linking them to her husband Stephen Belafonte, who has previously been accused of being violent and possessive towards a girlfriend. But yesterday he described the remarks as ‘disgusting’. He said, using typical celeb Twitter speak: ‘I don’t usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting wife which I think are quite disgusting untrue. ‘Mel was very ill a bunch of doctors help her get better if fans can’t just relax B4 being negative they r not real fans of Mel B.’ It was just a month ago that Belafonte presented his wife with a wedding ring ‘upgrade’ – a seven-carat diamond the size of a ten-pence piece. He handed her the ring just as she was about to go on air for The X Factor – a dramatic, romantic gesture. On Sunday night, however, the giant bauble was visibly absent from Mel Brown’s wedding finger. According to a well-placed source on The X Factor, Belafonte, 39, did not visit his wife of seven years during the three days she spent in hospital. Nor, says the source, was Belafonte with her at The X Factor studios for the final on Sunday. The fact that Mel B has removed her wedding ring ‘upgrade’ is surely an indicator that the seven-year marriage is in serious trouble. Could it be all over between them? It is telling that when the Mail contacted Mel B’s agent and publicist yesterday and asked whether the marriage was over, neither would confirm or deny the suggestion. The source revealed that Belafonte is not liked by other members of The X Factor team. ‘None of that means that he has ever laid a finger on Mel, but he is not an easy person to be with, that is obvious to see. It was a physical and emotional collapse. There was an emotional element to it, Mel has been under a lot of stress. ‘He didn’t come to the show on Sunday as far as I am aware. He wasn't in her dressing room. I don’t believe he visited her in hospital, either.’ Mel B was three hours late for an interview with Grazia, published online last night, in which she was described as 'not in the best of moods' and reportedly admitted an argument with Belafonte. 'I walked in pissed off because I had a big row with my husband about stupid stuff,' Grazia's Olivia Foster quoted the former Spice Girl as saying. 'Sometimes he p***** me off like no other, but he gets me.' 'Disgusting': Stephen Belafonte took to Twitter to slam speculation he was linked to marks seen on the star. Bruised? Fans took to Twitter during X Factor on Sunday to claim that Mel's face look bruised. Swollen? Some viewers said that Mel B's left cheek looked bruised during the X Factor final on Sunday night, while others remarked on apparent marks seen on her shoulders and the inside of her elbow (circled above) On Sunday, Belafonte was seen outside the Kensington block of flats where he and Mel, 39, have been renting an apartment since October, overseeing the loading of about 20 suitcases into a minivan. So what do we know of the events of the past few days? According to the X Factor source, Mel B was on her way to Wembley Arena on Thursday afternoon for a press conference with the judges and finalists when she was taken ill. ‘The driver, who has known Mel for a while and is a good guy, took her to A&E – he was that concerned – and she was admitted. ‘She was discharged on Sunday after asking the doctors if she could go at lunchtime.’ The source says that reports that Mel was in a high dependency unit may not be accurate. ‘That’s not to say that she wasn’t unwell, because she was.’ The source says Mel underwent tests, but would not say what these tests revealed. No wedding ring: Mel B appeared on X Factor on Sunday without her wedding ring. It's just a month since Belafonte presented her with a wedding ring ‘upgrade’ – a seven-carat diamond the size of a ten-pence piece. Speculation about the marriage has been so intense partly on account of Belafonte’s history. In 2007, shortly after their marriage in June that year, it emerged that Belafonte had been charged with battery in America after being arrested for attacking his then girlfriend, Nicole Contreras. He pleaded ‘no contest’ to the battery charge – which the judge stated was the same as a guilty plea – and was ordered to take part in a ‘Domestic Violence Batterers’ Programme’. In 2008, around the time Mel and Belafonte had a wedding blessing in Egypt, a friend of Miss Contreras told a newspaper about his violent and possessive character. Nicole is said to have told her friend: ‘I fear for Melanie because a leopard does not change his spots. ‘He seems utterly charming – but I’m afraid it won’t be long before his mask slips.’ Nicole told her friend that Stephen was over-possessive. ‘I would be away on photo shoots and Stephen would call my hotel room hundreds of times a night demanding: “Who the **** are you with, Nikki?” ‘One time we went out partying in Hollywood and Stephen was convinced a man in the bar was eyeing me up, which was total rubbish. Stephen followed him out of the bar and beat him senseless.’ Miss Contreras’s friend told the newspaper the relationship became on and off and finally ended after Belafonte told Nicole he’d met someone else. Nicole told the friend: ‘One night he turned to me and said, “Nikki, I’ve met someone who is very famous and very rich and wants to marry me but if you will have me back then I’ll forget it”. He wouldn’t say who she was but said, “She is so rich she could change my life”.’ Of course, these could be the observations of a woman scorned. But Mel B is certainly rich – she is worth an estimated £35million. The situation is messy. Since the marriage, Mel B has been estranged from her family. When her family learned she had been admitted to hospital, her mother, Andrea Brown, was forced to post a series of messages on Twitter pleading for information about her daughter. At her home in Leeds yesterday, Mrs Brown said she did not know any more about what had happened to her daughter than anyone else. Cursed? Couples who speak to Hello! about their idyllic relationships sometimes split shortly afterwards. Only last week, Mel B was Hello! Magazine’s cover story. It is customary for interviewees in Hello! to present a perfect family life and Mel was no exception. But has the famous curse of Hello! – by which couples who speak about their idyllic relationship split up shortly afterwards – struck again? In one photograph, Mel B is seated on a sofa with her husband and three daughters – Phoenix, 15, from her first marriage to dancer Jimmy Gulzar, seven-year-old Angel, from her relationship with actor Eddie Murphy, and Madison, she and Stephen’s three-year-old daughter. Mel gushed about how happy she was with Stephen. ‘He’s the first man I’ve ever trusted, he’s my rock and he’s the beginning and the end of who I am.’ In America, where she now lives, Mel B appears as a judge on America’s Got Talent and has starred in her own reality show, Mel B: It’s A Scary World. Mel was unsure whether the girl best known here as Scary Spice would go down well on X Factor, but the risk paid off and has revived her name in the UK. But the X Factor final of 2014, won by Ben Haenow, will now be remembered for all the mystery surrounding Mel’s hospital dash. Back in 2010, there were reports that the couple had split in the run-up to It’s A Scary World, but it was later claimed that the ‘split’ was a publicity stunt. Some may believe this latest episode, too, is a publicity stunt, a way of getting even with fellow judge and X Factor supremo, Simon Cowell, who had been critical of her act, Andrea Faustini. If it is a stunt, it’s a highly convincing act. Backstage on X Factor, it did not go unnoticed that Mel’s demeanour changed whenever her husband was about. Maybe that influence is slipping now and Mel has decided to break away.",

The two documents, dating from 2011 and 2012, are marked classified and 'NOFORN,' which means they were not meant to be shared with allied intelligence agencies, WikiLeaks said. The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders. CIA manuals offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by Wikleaks. Some are obvious -  don't buy a one-way ticket with cash the day before flying, although others are less so - don't look scruffy while traveling on a diplomatic passport. The manual states: 'Mental preparation almost certainly helps travelers pass secondary scrutiny.' The guide states that travelers who attract attention and appear suspicious qualify sentence meanings with 'words like “typically,” “normally,” “often,” “maybe,” or “almost” or phrases like “to be honest,” “the truth is,” or “swear to God.' There is a section devoted to baggage and lists reasons for detection including:. • Baggage or contents inconsistent with the passenger's appearance, profession, or ticket class. • An unexplained lack of baggage probably would raise suspicions. • Multiple new items, such as alarm clocks or notebooks, in baggage. • Carelessly packed baggage when passenger is purportedly an experienced business traveler. • Unopened and unmarked maps, guidebooks, or other literature. • Maps of unrelated cities in baggage for a purported tourist traveler. • Camera quality not matching the traveler's profile or camera memory card insufficient for a lengthy tourist trip. The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders. The guide lists countries which look for certain types of travelers - for example it states Japanese customs officials pay attention to single, Western travelers  'because they may be drug couriers.' Similarly it states that in Tel Aviv, officials are on the look-out for 'military-aged males traveling alone with backpacks... regardless of their nationality or skin color. In one incident during transit of a European airport in the early morning, security officials selected a CIA officer for secondary screening,' one of the documents reads. 'Although the officials gave no reason, overly casual dress inconsistent with being a diplomatic-passport holder may have prompted the referral.' The CIA agent involved went on to have his bag swabbed for explosives and it tested positive. Despite extensive questioning, he stuck to his cover story that he had been involved in counterterrorism training in the United States, and eventually was allowed to continue his journey. 'Consistent, well-rehearsed, and plausible cover is important for avoiding secondary selection and critical for surviving it,' the CIA wrote. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration' In a statement, WikiLeaks said this example 'begs the question: if the training that supposedly explained the explosives was only a cover story, what was a CIA officer really doing passing through (a European Union) airport with traces of explosives on him, and why was he allowed to continue?' One of the CIA documents, called 'Schengen Overview,' reveals that the CIA is very concerned about EU nations introducing biometric security measures for people traveling on US passports and that new systems pose an increased 'identity threat' - in other words, making it harder for agents to travel on false documents. The document focuses on the EU's Schengen area, a chunk of Europe in which travelers between 22 EU countries are no longer required to show passports. The CIA expressed concerns that a new EU security system will potentially make life harder for CIA agents. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration. These manuals show that under the Obama administration the CIA is still intent on infiltrating European Union borders and conducting clandestine operations in EU member states.'

Attempting to land on a rotating comet racing through the solar system at 150,000 mph is no easy feat. But why bother trying, when you can just fire off a harpoon to collect samples at a safe distance with surgical precision? That’s exactly what Nasa is attempting to do with its prototype designs of a space harpoon which it hopes will return rock samples that could reveal the origins of planets. Scroll down for video. Nasa is developing prototype designs of a space harpoon. Pictured is an artist's concept of a tethered 'penetrator' heading toward a celestial body to take a sample. ‘This technology will be able for the first time to pull samples of the order of a few kilograms from depths of a few metres, which could greatly enhance our knowledge of solar system objects,’ Robert Winglee of the University of Washington wrote in a Nasa report. ‘Moreover, it offers the opportunity to take multiple samples at little extra cost so that it will provide much greater flexibility and greatly enhance the science return for any given mission,’ he added. The conventional way to do a robotic sample-return mission is to perform a soft landing on a celestial object, collect small amounts of material and then return it to Earth. The technology will be able, for the first time, to pull samples of the order of a few kilograms from depths of a few metres from celestial objects such as comets. While Nasa is looking at the use of harpoons to collect samples for celestial bodies, British engineers believe similar technology could be used to clear up space junk. Stevenage-based Astrium has plans to develop 'chase' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target. Using laser and radar guidance systems, a piece of space junk would be targeted, and then captured with a gas-propelled harpoon on a tether. Once the space junk is secured, a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. Then the chase satellite would search out another target. Experts hope the system could remove around five pieces of space debris a year. This is what the Rosetta probe is planning to do in August when it reaches the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko– one of the most risky parts of its mission. ‘We're not talking about doing that,’ Professor Winglee said earlier this month, according to a report in Space.com. ‘We're talking about using the kinetic energy of the spacecraft as it's moving past the object, and we're not asking the system to brake, so you save energy.’ The team's design currently uses a sample-return spacecraft to carry six, rocket-shaped penetrators, which would be fired down at the celestial body during a flyby. The penetrators, attached to a tether, would hit at a high speed of up to 2,240 mph (3,605 km/h, or 1 km/sec) and go deep beneath the surface. Several pounds of material would then be collected in a tube, which would be reeled back in to send back to Earth. Researchers have been testing the equipment by firing test harpoons into a 55-gallon drum full of cometary simulant - sand, salt, pebbles or a mixture of each. The bow string is pulled back by an electric winch to generate a precise level of force, up to 1,000 pounds, firing the harpoon at 70mph. The team's design currently uses a sample-return spacecraft to carry six, rocket-shaped penetrators, which would be fired down at the celestial body during a flyby. A demonstration of the sample collection chamber is pictured. Lead engineer Donald Wegel said: ‘We had to bolt it to the floor, because the recoil made the whole testbed jump after every shot. 'We're not sure what we'll encounter on the comet – the surface could be soft and fluffy, mostly made up of dust, or it could be ice mixed with pebbles, or even solid rock. 'Most likely, there will be areas with different compositions, so we need to design a harpoon that's capable of penetrating a reasonable range of materials.’ Comets are frozen chunks of ice and dust left over from our solar system's formation. As such, scientists want a closer look at them for clues to the origin of planets and ultimately, how life formed on Earth. The technology could be used to collect samples from comets that could reveal how life forms on other planets. Pictured is Comet Ison before it burnt up following a flyby close to the sun."

Inyanga, who had been drinking and taking drugs, demanded Mr Turner and his friend 'get outside now,' said prosecutor Emma Atkinson. The pair made it clear they did not want to fight, but he punched both of them, Teesside Crown Court heard. The blow to Mr Turner caused him to fall to the floor and he lost consciousness. As a result of the attack he has suffered hearing lose and tinnitus. Inyanga ran away from the fast food restaurant on October 10 last year, but later handed himself in. When police examined his phone they found text messages which contained the phrase 'battered for rudely interrupting'. He told officers he was offended when the two men 'came a bit too close' and Mr Turner was quoted as saying: 'It's a free country.' The attack happened at McDonald's in Middlesbrough, Teesside, after Mr Turner had approached Inyanga and asked him if he had a cigarette lighter. Inyanga, who had no previous convictions, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and common assault. Scott Taylor, defending, said: 'Nothing could have been said that would have provoked the action that happened. 'He has shown remorse. He asked that I pass on his sincere apologies to both individuals.' Judge Howard Crowson said: 'This is the tragedy of it. These are both placid men, neither of them violent. 'You probably never intended any such harm, not that level,' he added. Inyanga of Middlesbrough, was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for 18 months. He was also made the subject of a four-month tagged curfew, ordered to complete 150 hours' unpaid work and a pay £1,000 compensation. Speaking after the hearing Mr Turner from Hartlepoole said: 'I think the sentence is probably better than him going to actual prison. Promising university student, Inyanga, was handed a suspended prison sentence after he admitted the attack. 'It still affects me quite a lot, in every way really. Being a tool-maker, sound is part of my job as well. 'It's got a lot better since hospital. It's still not the same as it was.' He said he remembered little of the assault: 'I don't go out to fight. I just go out to have a good time. I'd rather hug someone than fight them. 'I woke up in hospital getting told I was attacked. It left me wondering why. I was very confused. 'I remember waking up strapped down to a table with this horrible thing around my head, X-raying me. That petrified me. 'I woke up in the trauma ward and I was alone, just bawling my eyes out.'"

                "targets": "By. David Martosko In Washington. PUBLISHED:. 21:37 EST, 20 August 2013. |. UPDATED:. 06:06 EST, 21 August 2013. The Obama administration convened a cabinet-level meeting Tuesday afternoon to decide whether U.S. military aid to Egypt will continue, just hours after an aide to a Democratic senator told a reporter the aid had already been placed on a temporary hold. The U.S. is on schedule to provide Egypt, the most populous nation in the Arab world, with about $1.5 billion in various aid packages, a majority of which is in the form of aid to the nation's military. 'POTUS's Situation Room meeting on Egypt started on time, at 2:30pm,' a White House pool reporter wrote at 4:15pm. 'It's unclear whether pool will have [an] end time.' Supply: The U.S. provides Egypt with military equipment as part of a $1.3bn foreign aid program. On Tuesday a staffer in the office of Vermont Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told The Daily Beast that most military aid and weapons deliveries to Egypt had been halted by the administration, along with civilian economic aid. But the White House quickly denied those reports, saying no decision had been reached. Its afternoon meeting of top brass marks a critical moment in the history of U.S.-Egypt relations. The Obama administration's choice of whether to cancel future military aid will be seen as a sign that the White House is choosing sides in the urban warfare that has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 so far. Islamist protesters are demanding a return to power by former president Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. A military coup seized power on July 3. The White House has taken pains to avoid calling it a coup, however, as that designation would have forced the government to cut off aid immediately. The Foreign Assistance Act, which dates back to 1961, declares that funds allocated to foreign countries become an option exercise if the target nation's 'duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup or decree'. Presidents since then have displayed great flexibility in interpreting that language, however, despite the lack of a written exception in the law for national security emergencies. The Obama administration understands that American interests are served by maintaining a working relationship with Egypt's politically powerful armed forces. But in addition to a desire to avoid being the administration that 'lost' Egypt, Obama's senior team wants the administration to seem outraged by the military's attacks on pro-Muslim Brotherhood protesters. Most U.S. aid comes in the form of cash transfers to American military contractors, who then produce and deliver small arms and heavy equipment, including the M1A1 Abrams tank, the F-16 fighter jet and the M16 assault rifle. Aid: Cash transfers are given to military contractors who deliver equipment such as Apache helicopters. Order: Tanks, such as this one pictured guarding Cairo, are also supplied. In addition to those weapons,. American defense contractors provide training and spare parts, requiring. constant contact with military officers in Egypt. It's that contact,. experts say, that allows the U.S. to give the Egyptians a westernized. frame of reference - one that's favorable to the United States. Israel is the only nation to get more U.S. aid than Egypt since the end of the 1940s. Through 2011, the U.S. had committed $71.6bn in military and economic aid to maintaining good U.S-Egyptian relations and peace between Egypt and Israel.The Huffington Post published a list of some of the weapons packs that have been included:125 M1A1 Abrams tanksCost: $1.3 billion in 2011Defense Contractor: General Dynamics; Honeywell; Allison Transmission24 F-16 fighter aircraftCost: $3.2 billion in 2009Defense Contractor: Lockheed MartinSix Frigate WarshipsCost: $210 million in 2010Defense Contractor: VSC Global6,900 anti-armor missilesCost: $319 million in 2008Defense Contractor: Raytheon12 Apache helicoptersCost: $820 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Boeing400 Hellfire missilesCost: $51 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Hellfire Limited6 Chinook helicoptersCost: $308 million in 2009Defense Contractor: Boeing2,000 TOW missilesCost: $99 million in 2007Defense Contractor: Raytheon4 Blackhawk helicoptersCost: $167 million in 2008Defense Contractor: Sikorsky. 'We. want them to be addicted to U.S. military technology because that gives. us leverage,' Middle East expert and national security columnist. Richard Miniter told MailOnline. 'Our. equipment requires lots of ongoing training -- think aircraft avionics. -- whereas the Chinese stuff, for instance, doesn't require as much. Military-to-military contact creates a military culture that's. friendlier to the rule of law and democracy. 'Informal contact between military officers can be more productive, over time, than diplomatic summits.' In addition, the U.S. is delivering aid to Egypt in part to buy preferential access to the Suez Canal and military jet flyover rights. The two countries' relationship dates to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter brought Egypt and Israel together with pledges of peace from both, and economic aid from the U.S.At present, the $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt is the United States' fourth-largest such commitment. Israel gets $3 billion each year; Iraq receives $2.1 billion; and the U.S. sends Pakistan $1.7 billion. If the White House were to decide to forgo the benefits it receives and pull back its aid packages, it's unlikely the Egyptian military would feel any kind of budget pinch. Saudi Arabia promised Monday that it would make up for any shortfall Egypt's military had as a result of western nations canceling their commitments. The Saudis already provide the bulk of a $12 billion annual aid package from wealthy Arab countries. And killing what amounts to a make-work program for favored military contractors - Egypt, according to an August 8 NPR analysis, already has more heavy weaponry than it needs - would cost U.S. jobs. A manager at Lockheed Martin told MailOnline on background that while Egypt's acquisitions of U.S. hardware isn't the difference between any one company's life or death, the total of military aid to foreign countries represents a significant part of their business. 'There are companies that would lay. off 500 to 1,000 people if the government stopped subsidizing all this. equipment to overseas.' Mr Miniter said another reason to be wary of disconnecting with Egypt's military leaders is that recent history shows the U.S. can find itself in a predicament if it tries to intervene later for national security reasons. Unrest: A military checkpoint in Cairo checks vehicles after a curfew was imposed. 'When we disengaged from the Pakistanis in the 1990s, all the military-to-military contact declined,' he recalled. 'But after 9/11 - after just a decade or so - the military leaders there suddenly were Islamists, bearded, different. Working with them became much more challenging. The same thing could happen in Egypt.'"

A survey of the week wouldn't be complete without a left-handed salute -- not to be confused with a backhanded compliment -- to the gleeful rubbish of Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!\n7. Even as a documentary, this is one of the most audacious and energetic films of the year\n8.

Yet another of those dysfunctional-family-at-the-holidays movies that aim to elicit smiles of recognition but are more likely to make you wince in pain.\n5. What's striking and, to my bloodshot eye, welcome about this year's edition, The Family Stone, is the rather chic urbanity with which writer-director Thomas Bezucha serves up the old genre standby.\n6. The plot is motored more by convenience than credible character behavior and for much of the time, the cockles of our hearts remain unwarmed.\n7. Almost everything about The Family Stone is so schematic and prefabricated that it should come with its own easy-to-follow blueprint.\n8. A potentially interesting tale flailing haplessly in the quicksand of holiday-movie formula, this domestic dramedy from writer-director Thomas Bezucha is most potently read in reverse of its intentions.\n9. Sarah Jessica Parker's nimble performance is reason alone to see this creaky fairy tale about a Manhattan executive marrying into an unhappy family.\n10. I love it dearly. I have seen it twice.

The fact that you care about each and every one of these people is testament to the filmmakers' understanding and abiding humanity.\n6. There's enough material here for a miniseries, but the directors keep the proceedings to 78 brisk minutes without making the viewer feel cheated.\n7.

The excellent new drama In Bloom, Georgia's Oscar entry in the foreign-language category, has the heartbreak and hope of a country slipped inside a coming-of age-story of two 14-year-old girls.\n10. A fascinating snapshot of a country at war with itself (literally, eventually) as seen through the eyes of two teenage girls, whose lives are complicated enough as it is."

The chances of it pounding our planet and leaving us for the dead? Zero, experts say. \n  \n \"Although there is no possibility for the asteroid to collide with our planet, this will be a very close approach for an asteroid of this size,\" NASA said in a statement. \n  \n What size are we talking about? Measurements taken by NASA's NEOWISE space probe indicate the asteroid is about 2,000 feet (650 meters) in size. That's about 670 yards (613 meters), or about the length of six NFL football fields. \n  \n And how close is \"very close\"? NASA says this rock will come about 1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) from Earth. That's about 4.6 times the distance from Earth to the moon. The moon, by the way, is about 239,000 miles (384,400 kilometers) from Earth. \n  \n While several small asteroids pass within this distance of Earth a few times a week, this is the closest by any known asteroid of this size or bigger in 13 years -- since asteroid Toutatis in 2004, according to the space agency. \n  \n Can you see asteroid 2014 JO25? Well, maybe. This asteroid has a reflective surface and you might be able to see it with a telescope. \n  \n \"The asteroid will approach Earth from the direction of the sun and will become visible in the night sky after April 19,\" NASA said. \n  \n If you don't have your own telescope, you can watch the asteroid online. \n  \n Astronomers discovered 2014 J025 three years ago (you guessed it in 2014). This will be its closest encounter with Earth for the last 400 years. NASA said telescopes around the world will be trained on it during the flyby to try to learn more about it. \n  \n \"Radar observations are planned at NASA's Goldstone Solar System Radar in California and the National Science Foundation's Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, and the resulting radar images could reveal surface details as small as a few meters,\" NASA said. \n  \n If you head out to try to spot the asteroid, you might also want to check out comet PanSTARRS (C/2015 ER61). It also is making its closest approach to Earth -- coming about 109 million miles (175 million kilometers) from the planet.

With the possibility of New Year’s Eve floor festivities looming, Congress could find itself voting on the final day of the year for the first time in more than four decades. \n  \n Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was eager to demonstrate that the Senate was ready to move on any idea presented by the White House or the House even as things seemed to be careening toward failure on Thursday. \n  \n “Members of the House of Representatives are out watching movies and watching their kids play soccer and basketball and doing all kinds of things,” said Mr. Reid, in a ferocious floor attack on the House that he returned to periodically throughout the day Thursday, like an angry father-in-law revisiting a grudge he’s been nursing all year. “They should be here.” \n  \n Not to be outdone, Speaker John A. Boehner, who failed last week to cobble together enough votes for his own bill, ordered House members to return on Sunday. Saying it was the Senate’s turn to come up with an idea, he told fellow Republicans on a conference call, “The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass, but the Senate must act.” \n  \n Absent a solution — or even a pathway to a bill — senators whiled away the hours without any agreement, debating and voting on amendments to a surveillance measure, pondering hurricane aid, and swearing in a new senator from Hawaii. Retiring senators, who had anticipated that their services would no longer be needed, worked in offices in varying states of disassembly, their staffs pecking out e-mails on iPads because their computers had been carted away. \n  \n A meeting at the White House between President Obama and Congressional leaders scheduled for Friday offered either the promise that a resolution of the fiscal debacle was in view or a portentous sign that each side was doing all it could to make sure that it could escape blame for a potential fiscal meltdown. No one was quite sure which. \n  \n Amid the absurdity of an urgent, nonurgent holiday session, there was the odd hum of normalcy. Senators fulminated about espionage for hours on the Senate floor as they debated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Congressional aides wore their workday best as they sped through hallways, clutching their phones. Taco Thursday continued as it does each week in the small carryout restaurant where staff members collect lunches to be eaten at desks. Mr. Paul, as per usual, tussled with the leadership over one of his amendments. \n  \n Mostly, people just looked mad. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, his tie slightly askew, looked as gloomy as the clouds hovering over the Capitol dome. “I didn’t realize how much I didn’t want to be here until I got here,” said Mr. Schumer, who had taken the red eye from San Francisco, where he had arrived only days earlier to visit his daughter. \n  \n A single senator was seen smiling: Brian Schatz, who was appointed on Wednesday by the governor of Hawaii to fill the term of the late Senator Daniel K. Inouye, held the arm of his fellow Hawaii Democrat, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, as he walked across the Senate floor to meet Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who administered the oath to the new senator. His duties complete, Mr. Biden was immediately descended upon by reporters eager for a morsel of news; he did not oblige. \n  \n The Congressional impasse over how to avoid tax increases and spending cuts has left this entire city gripping Starbucks cups procured from Georgetown to Capitol Hill, bearing the message “come together,” to wait in low-grade misery for the next chapter in the drama. This would be Sunday night, when House members arrive, just ahead of New Year’s Eve at the summons of their leaders, who decided Thursday that they could not afford to be home killing time while Senate Democratic leaders took to C-Span to take shots at the absent House. \n  \n As the nation awaited news — any news! — about what would happen to the nation’s fiscal health, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex therapist, volunteered on Twitter that lawmakers who could not compromise “probably aren’t good lovers.” That was around midday. \n  \n Many retiring senators’ offices looked empty and gloomy, and boxes full of years of archives piled up around the Hart Senate Office Building. The office of Mr. Inouye was jam-packed with floral arrangements, and smelled of lilies and chai tea. On the door of the office of retiring Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, was a sign imploring visitors to rap with a coin or key “so the sound will carry,” and retiring Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska’s, office was absent even his name plate; a flag for his home state lingered. \n  \n The House and Senate have held numerous pro forma sessions during the week between Christmas and New Year over the years, and in 1995 during a major budget battle. But the last time they held roll call votes that week, before Thursday, was during the second session of the 91st Congress, in 1970, amid a large spending fight and a filibuster over financing for a supersonic transport plane. \n  \n Not everyone decided to make the trip Thursday. About 10 senators missed a series of votes, including Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, and Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, who has retired. ||||| Enlarge Image Close AP President Barack Obama waves to reporters as he steps off the Marine One helicopter and walks on the South Lawn at the White House on Thursday. \n  \n Congress and the White House took small steps toward breaking the budget impasse Thursday, but Democrats and Republicans grew increasingly fearful they won't be able to avert the tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff, a prospect that is unnerving consumers and investors. \n  \n President Barack Obama invited congressional leaders to the White House on Friday afternoon for a last-ditch effort to broker a deal, as the Senate returned to Washington on Thursday. House GOP leaders said in a Thursday conference call with Republicans, who are growing nervous about their party being blamed for the deadlock, that the House will reconvene Sunday evening. \n  \n Enlarge Image Close Reuters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, above, returns to the Capitol Thursday, where he tangled with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. \n  \n It is still possible the two sides can reach a deal, especially with the leaders meeting Friday. Any resolution would be a scaled-back version of the package Mr. Obama and congressional leaders had anticipated passing after the November election. The White House is pressing for the Senate to extend current tax rates for income up to $250,000, extend unemployment benefits, keep the alternative minimum tax from hitting millions of additional taxpayers and delay spending cuts set to take effect in January. \n  \n The 11th-hour strategy carries enormous risk because it leaves no margin for error in Congress's balky legislative machinery. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said the prospects for passage of a bill before the last day of the year are fading rapidly. \"I have to be very honest,\" he said. \"I don't know time-wise how it can happen now.\" \n  \n Anxiety about Washington's ability to resolve its budget battles is roiling the economy. Conference Board figures showed that consumer confidence fell in December to its lowest level since August, driven by a pessimistic outlook for economic activity next year. \n  \n Stocks have swung on the latest news from Washington. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply on Mr. Reid's pessimistic comments before recouping most of a 151-point drop on news the House would reconvene this weekend. \n  \n At best, leaders are looking at a narrow bill that could be passed at the last minute. At the meeting Friday, Mr. Obama will outline the elements he thinks should be in a deal and could get majority support in both chambers of Congress, according to a person familiar with the matter. He won't put forward a specific bill or legislative language, the person added. \n  \n Related Video \n  \n Last August, President Obama and Congress put the U.S. economy on course to go over a \"fiscal cliff.\" WSJ's David Wessel tells you everything you need to know about the \"cliff\" but were afraid to ask. \n  \n As the high-stakes showdown over the fiscal cliff continues, Republicans and Democrats continue to debate how much the richest Americans should pay in taxes. WSJ's David Wessel heads to a poker table to explain the controversial issue. \n  \n Missing the year-end deadline would mean an income-tax increase Jan. 1 for virtually all taxpayers and spending cuts of $110 billion in defense and domestic programs. For months, economists have warned that going over the cliff could thrust the U.S. back into recession. \n  \n Most officials say they believe any deal is most likely to emerge in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) left the door open to looking at a White House proposal, although noted the difficulty of \"coming up against a hard deadline here.\" \n  \n Whether or not there is a deal, the weeks since the election have produced a stark display of political gridlock. \"The government is not working,\" said Steve Bell, senior director of the Bipartisan Policy Center, who was a senior budget adviser to Senate Republicans for many years. \"There is no doubt that the policy-making apparatus in this town has collapsed.\" \n  \n Following the tea-party wave in the 2010 election, the 112th Congress looks set to be the least productive in recent history. By the end of November, the House had passed 146 bills over the previous two years, by far the smallest number for any Congress since 1948. The Senate passed fewer bills in 2012 than in any year since at least 1992. \n  \n Rather than smoothing over differences, the November election appears to have hardened them. \"We came out of the election with both sides thinking they won and had an equal mandate,\" said Ross Baker, a professor at Rutgers University who is now interviewing lawmakers on Capitol Hill for a book on bipartisanship. \"One problem is we don't have a common narrative to guide us.\" \n  \n Falling Over the Fiscal Cliff See some scenarios for how different groups of people may be affected by the tax changes that will take place if the fiscal cliff isn't resolved by the Jan. 1., 2013, deadline.

By then, they had reduced their differences to a range most congressional veterans could imagine being bridged in past eras when party leaders were more practiced at the art of compromise. \n  \n \"We are at the point of no return,\" said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to Mr. Reid, who also thinks it isn't possible to seal a deal before the deadline. \"And so off the cliff the country will go.\" \n  \n Mr. Obama called Messrs. Boehner, McConnell, Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) late Wednesday during his holiday vacation in Hawaii \"to receive an update on the ongoing fiscal negotiations,\" White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said. \n  \n The calls mark the first time Mr. Obama has called Mr. McConnell, who is now seen as key to brokering a deal, directly to discuss the fiscal cliff. \n  \n While the Senate returned from its Christmas holiday Thursday, it worked on legislation unrelated to the fiscal cliff. Mr. Reid taunted House Republican leaders for still being in recess, a criticism that stung some House Republicans, who complained to their leadership. \n  \n In their conference call Thursday afternoon, House GOP leaders announced they were calling members back into session Sunday evening in hopes that there would by then be a budget agreement to approve. They also told members to expect to stay in town through the following Friday, suggesting the possibility of a prolonged fight. \n  \n Republicans participating in the call said they believed GOP leaders were prepared to move quickly, if the fiscal cliff deadline is breached, to bring up legislation to reverse the tax increases and spending cuts retroactively. That action could be taken by a new session of Congress, which will be sworn in Jan. 3. \n  \n For all the economic anxiety about going over the fiscal cliff, there are political advantages to both parties for postponing action. There will be more Democrats in the new House and Senate. Mr. Boehner would have his re-election as speaker behind him, one of the first acts the new Congress will take. He has denied his job security is a concern, and no one has announced a campaign to challenge him. \n  \n —Siobhan Hughes, Michael Crittenden and Neil King Jr. contributed to this article. \n  \n Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Carol E.

He cut that trip short to return to Washington in an attempt to reach a deal before the end of the year. \n  \n Some signs suggested Thursdya that work on a new deal had already begun. \n  \n Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) said he understood the president had reached out to Senate Republicans with a proposal, while a GOP leadership aide in the Senate said: “We’re expecting the Democrats to finally act.” \n  \n McConnell later on Thursday struck an optimistic tone, and said he was looking forward to a proposal from Obama. \n  \n “Hopefully there is still time for an agreement of some kind that saves taxpayers from a wholly, wholly preventable economic crisis,” he said. \n  \n McConnell also warned the White House and Democrats should not expect Senate Republicans to simply roll over and \"write a blank check\" for anything Senate Democrats put forward \"just because we find ourselves at the edge of the cliff.” \n  \n “That wouldn’t be fair to the American people,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor. \n  \n Senate Democrats and the White House said no formal legislation was headed from Obama to Capitol Hill, but Friday's meeting and the scheduling maneuvers showed a final effort was in the works to prevent tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled for January that economists warn would trigger a recession. \n  \n House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said the House could remain in session through Jan. 2, noting that the 113th Congress will be sworn in the day after. \n  \n Talks have been stuck since the House failed to move Boehner’s “Plan B” proposal last week. \n  \n Boehner’s bill would have extended tax rates on annual incomes below $1 million, but the Speaker pulled his legislation before it reached the floor because of a lack of support from his own conference. \n  \n During the conference call, Boehner reiterated what he and other GOP leaders had said publicly, which is that the House had acted on a pair of bills that would prevent the crisis and that it is up to the Senate to act. \n  \n The Speaker argued that legislation approved by the House in August to extend all of the current individual tax rates, coupled with a bill moved by the lower chamber last week that would replace spending cuts known as the “sequester,” would prevent the nation from going over the fiscal cliff. \n  \n He said it was up to the Senate to amend those bills and return them to the House if they are not acceptable in their present form. \n  \n “Once this has occurred, the House will then consider whether to accept the bills as amended, or to send them back to the Senate with additional amendments,” Boehner said, according to a source familiar with his comments. “The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass — but the Senate must act.\" \n  \n While Senate and House Republicans have both called on Senate Democrats and Obama to move, Boehner’s failed gambit with his $1 million proposal appeared to increase the president’s leverage in the talks. Obama already enjoyed an advantage over Republicans because of his decisive Election Day victory, and polls that suggest Republicans could take more of a blame if the nation goes over the cliff. \n  \n Obama last week said he would reach for a smaller deal that would extend tax rates on annual incomes below $250,000 while allowing rates above that threshold to rise. Obama also said he would seek an extension of unemployment benefits, but would put off broader entitlement reforms until next year, as well as a hike to the debt ceiling. \n  \n It is unclear whether Republicans would move legislation that only extends rates on annual incomes below $250,000, however. \n  \n While McConnell seemed to offer some hope that a deal could be reached, Reid on Thursday said a deal seemed unlikely before the end-of-year deadline. \n  \n “I have to be honest — I don’t know, time-wise, how it can happen now,” Reid said. \n  \n In a later appearance on the Senate floor, he scolded Republicans for obstructing a deal and criticized House Republicans for leaving town. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Peter Schroeder contributed to this story. \n  \n —This story was posted at 3:02 p.m. and last updated at 7:55 p.m. ||||| WASHINGTON — President Obama will meet with Congressional leaders on Friday, and House Republicans summoned lawmakers back for a Sunday session, in a last-ditch effort to avert a fiscal crisis brought on by automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to hit next week. \n  \n Republicans expressed a flicker of hope Thursday that a deal could still be reached to at least avert most of the tax increases on Jan. 1, to prevent a sudden cut in payments to medical providers treating Medicare patients and to extend expiring unemployment benefits. But both parties’ leaders said time is running out. \n  \n “Here we are, five days from the New Year, and we might finally start talking,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader. \n  \n The overriding emotion Thursday, as senators convened for a rare session between Christmas and New Year’s Day, appeared to be embarrassment. The continuing impasse “demonstrates a tremendous lack of courage here in Washington to address the issues that need to be addressed — at every level,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \n  \n Lawmakers and aides from both parties cautioned that the burst of activity could be more about making sure the other side gets the blame than any real search for a resolution before the Jan. 1 deadline. Under Senate rules, no deal could run the gantlet of procedural hurdles in time for a final vote before the deadline without all the senators agreeing not to slow progress. \n  \n Photo \n  \n “I have to be very honest,” Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Thursday. “I don’t know timewise how it can happen now.” \n  \n White House officials continued to put the onus on Republicans to clear a procedural path to a quick vote on a negotiated deal. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n “The only way America goes over the cliff is if the Republican leaders in the House and the Senate decide to push us by blocking passage of bills to extend tax cuts or the middle class,” said the White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer. “It’s a question of their willingness to put country before party.” \n  \n Republicans said there was nothing preventing Mr. Reid from putting formal legislation on the Senate floor, and to date, no such bill has been written. \n  \n But the contours of a fallback deal did come into view Thursday, even as the will to achieve it lagged behind. \n  \n Republicans involved in the talks said both sides would probably be able to agree to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts up to some income threshold higher than Mr. Obama’s $250,000 cutoff but lower than the $1 million sought by the House speaker, John A. Boehner. To that, leaders would probably agree to add provisions to stop the alternative minimum tax from suddenly enlarging to hit more middle class households, and possibly to extend expiring unemployment benefits. \n  \n Video \n  \n Republicans would be far less receptive to Mr. Obama’s call to temporarily suspend across-the-board spending cuts unless such a suspension was accompanied by significant and immediate spending cuts elsewhere. \n  \n But no such deal could be reached without significant, face-to-face negotiations between the president, Senate leaders and House leaders, aides said. McConnell aides said a phone call between the president and the Senate Republican leader Wednesday night was the first outreach Mr. McConnell has had from any Democrat since Thanksgiving. \n  \n “It appears to me the action, if there is any, will be on the Senate side,” Mr. McConnell said Thursday afternoon on the Senate floor. \n  \n After a House Republican leadership conference call on Thursday, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, announced that House members would return to Washington on Sunday for legislative business, with votes in the evening. Lawmakers were warned that the House might be in session through Jan. 2, the day the 112th Congress disbands. The next day, the 113th Congress will convene, wiping out any unfinished work of the past two years. \n  \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n  \n Between such glimmers of hope, the talk in Washington on Thursday was anything but conciliatory. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Republicans would use an imminent fight over raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit to fight for big spending cuts, and compared that to taking one’s own child hostage and threatening to kill it. \n  \n On the Senate floor Thursday, Mr. Reid excoriated House Republicans for failing to consider a Senate-passed measure that would extend lower tax rates on household income up to $250,000. He urged House members to return to the Capitol to put together at least a modest deal to avoid the more than a half-trillion dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to begin in January. \n  \n “The American people are waiting for the ball to drop,” Mr. Reid said, “but it’s not going to be a good drop.” ||||| President Barack Obama will meet with congressional leaders at the White House on Friday in search of a compromise to avoid a year-end \"fiscal cliff\" of across-the-board tax increases and deep spending cuts. \n  \n House Minority Whip Rep.

(Associated Press) \n  \n The development capped a day of growing urgency. Obama returned early from a Hawaiian vacation while lawmakers snarled across a partisan divide, leaders in each party blaming the other for an episode of government gridlock that threatens the economy with a new recession. \n  \n Adding to the woes confronting the middle class was a pending spike of $2 per gallon or more in milk prices if lawmakers failed to pass farm legislation by year's end. \n  \n Four days before the deadline, the White House disputed reports that Obama was sending lawmakers a scaled-down plan to avoid the fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts. \n  \n Administration officials confirmed the Friday meeting at the White House in a bare-bones announcement that said the president would \"host a meeting.\" \n  \n A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner quickly issued a statement that said the Ohio Republican would attend and \"continue to stress that the House has already passed legislation to avert the entire fiscal cliff and now the Senate must act.\" \n  \n Top Senate leaders said they remain ready to seek a last-minute agreement. Yet there was no legislation pending and no sign of negotiations in either the House or the Senate on a bill to prevent the tax hikes and spending cuts that economists say could send the economy into a recession. \n  \n Far from conciliatory, the rhetoric was confrontational and at times unusually personal. \n  \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., accused House Speaker John Boehner of running a dictatorship, citing his refusal to call a vote on legislation to keep taxes steady for most while letting them rise at upper incomes. The bill \"would pass overwhelmingly,\" Reid predicted, and said the Ohio Republican won't change his mind because he fears it might cost him re-election as speaker when the new Congress convenes next week. \n  \n Boehner seems \"to care more about keeping his speakership than keeping the nation on a firm financial footing,\" he said in remarks on the Senate floor. \n  \n A few hours later, McConnell expressed frustration and blamed the standoff on Obama and the Democrats. \"Republicans have bent over backwards. We stepped way, way out of our comfort zone,\" he said, referring to GOP offers to accept higher tax rates on some taxpayers. \n  \n \"We wanted an agreement, but we had no takers. The phone never rang, and so here we are five days from the new year and we might finally start talking,\" McConnell said. \n  \n Still, he warned: \"Republicans aren't about to write a blank check for anything the Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves at the edge of the cliff.\" \n  \n Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Boehner, responded in a similar vein to Reid's comments. \"Harry Reid should talk less and legislate more if he wants to avert the fiscal cliff. The House has already passed legislation to do so,\" he said, referring to a measure that extends existing cuts at all income levels. \n  \n Addressing the GOP rank and file by conference call, Boehner said the next move is up to the Senate, which has yet to act on House-passed bills to retain expiring tax cuts at all income levels and replace across-the-board spending cuts with targeted savings aimed largely at social programs. \n  \n \"The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass - but the Senate must act,\" he said, according to a participant in the call. \n  \n Boehner told Republican lawmakers the House would convene on Sunday evening. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., an ally of the speaker, quoted him as having said \"he didn't really intend to put on the floor something that would pass with all the Democratic votes and few of the Republican votes.\" \n  \n The risk of higher milk prices stems from the possibility that existing farm programs will expire at year's end, and neither chamber of Congress has scheduled a vote on even a temporary extension to prevent a spike. There have been unverified estimates that the cost to consumers of a gallon of milk could double without action by Congress. \n  \n The president flew home from Hawaii overnight after speaking with top congressional leaders. \n  \n Before leaving the White House last Friday, the president had called on lawmakers to pass scaled-down legislation that prevents tax increases for the middle class, raises rates at upper incomes and renews expiring unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless. He said he still supports a more sweeping measure to include spending cuts to reduce deficits, but said they could wait until the new year. \n  \n That capped an unpredictable week in which Boehner pivoted away from comprehensive deficit reduction talks with Obama to an aborted attempt to push legislation through the House that retained existing tax levels except above $1 million. Anti-tax Republicans rebelled at raising rates on million-dollar earners, and Boehner backpedaled and canceled the planned vote. \n  \n Without congressional action, current tax rates will expire on Dec. 31, resulting in a $536 billion tax increase over a decade that would touch nearly all Americans. In addition, the military and other federal departments would have to begin absorbing about $110 billion in spending cuts. \n  \n Failure to avoid the \"fiscal cliff\" doesn't necessarily mean tax increases and spending cuts would become permanent, since the new Congress could pass legislation cancelling them retroactively after it begins its work next year. \n  \n But gridlock through the end of the year would mark a sour beginning to a two-year extension of divided government that resulted from last month's elections in which Obama won a new term and Republicans retained their majority in the House. \n  \n The tax issue in particular has been Obama's first test of muscle after his re-election in November. He ran for a new term calling for higher taxes on the wealthy, and postelection public opinion polls show continued support for his position. \n  \n Boehner's decision to support higher rates on million-dollar earners marked a significant break with long-standing GOP orthodoxy, but the resistance among his rank and file so far has trumped him as well as any mandate the president claims. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writers Alan Fram and Jim Kuhnhenn contributed to this report. ||||| A Senate Democrat says he believes \"odds are better than people think\" that a deal can be reached to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts next week. \n  \n New York's Chuck Schumer tells NBC's \"Today\" show he's encouraged that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is getting \"actively engaged\" in talks to resolve the problem. \n  \n Appearing on the same show Friday, Republican Sen.

At hearings that started Monday at the court's headquarters in the Hague, Tehran asked judges at the world court to urgently suspend the sanctions to protect Iranian interests while the case challenging their legality is being heard—a process that can take years. The AP has much more: Background: Trump said in May that he would pull the United States out of a 2015 agreement over Iran's nuclear program and would re-impose sanctions on Tehran. Washington also threatened other countries with sanctions if they don't cut off Iranian oil imports by early November. US response: In a written statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the legal move an attempt by Tehran \"to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States to take lawful actions, including re-imposition of sanctions, which are necessary to protect our national security.\" The United States, which argues that the court does not have jurisdiction in the case, is to present its legal arguments to judges on Tuesday. More on Iran's argument: Iranian representative Mohsen Mohebi told the court the US decision was a clear breach of the 1955 treaty as it was \"intended to damage, as severely as possible, Iran's economy.\" Mohebi said the re-imposition of sanctions was unjustified as Iran was abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal. He said sanctions are already having damaging effects on Iran's economy and society and threaten to further destabilize the volatile Mideast. More background: The 1955 treaty was signed when the US and Iran were still allies following the 1953 revolution—fomented by Britain and the US—that ultimately cemented the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Iran and the US have a history of litigation at the International Court of Justice, in cases covering crises including the Tehran embassy hostage-taking and the shooting down of an Iranian passenger jet mistaken by a US warship for a fighter jet.

Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes. \n  \n STRAIT OF HORMUZ \n  \n Tangsiri said Iran had full control of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz that leads into it. Closing the strait would be the most direct way of blocking shipping. \n  \n “We can ensure the security of the Persian Gulf and there is no need for the presence of aliens like the U.S. and the countries whose home is not in here,” he said in the quote, which appeared in English translation on Tasnim. \n  \n He added: “All the carriers and military and non-military ships will be controlled and there is full supervision over the Persian Gulf. Our presence in the region is physical and constant and night and day.” \n  \n Later on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a Twitter post: “The Islamic Republic of Iran does not control the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is an international waterway. The United States will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways.” \n  \n The head of the Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said on Monday that Iran’s enemies would not prevail in a conflict. \n  \n “The enemies are strictly avoiding any conflict with Iran because they know that it will not be beneficial for them,” Jafari said, according to Tasnim. \n  \n As tension has escalated between Iran and the United States, senior U.S. officials have said they aim to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero. \n  \n Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most senior authority in the Islamic Republic, said last month that he supported the idea that if Iran is not allowed to export oil, then no country should export oil from the Gulf. ||||| People walk toward the International Court of Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands, Monday Aug. 27, 2018.

Trump has repeatedly pointed to those omissions in referring to the accord as the \"worst deal ever.\" \n  \n Mohebi said the re-imposition of sanctions was unjustified as Iran was abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal. He said sanctions are already having damaging effects on Iran's economy and society and threaten to further destabilize the volatile Mideast. \n  \n \"This policy is nothing but a naked economic aggression against my country,\" Mohebi told the court. \n  \n The United States, which argues that the court does not have jurisdiction in the case, is to present its legal arguments to judges on Tuesday. \n  \n Pompeo said lawyers would \"vigorously defend\" the U.S. and \"and we will continue to work with our allies to counter the Iranian regime's destabilizing activities in the region, block their financing of terror, and address Iran's proliferation of ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons systems that threaten international peace and stability.

                "inputs": "Nunavut RCMP say the search is over for two Dutch skiers who fell through ice near Bathurst Island, about 200 kilometres north of Resolute, Nunavut. Both are presumed drowned. \n  \n According to the Cold Facts organization's website, Marc Cornelissen and Philip de Roo were on a two-month scientific study of the area's ice for the organization. The site says part of their research involved interviewing local hunters about ice conditions. \n  \n The two men left Resolute on skis April 6 for the Last Ice Survey. \n  \n In a news release, the Dutch support team says that on Wednesday morning, the base camp received an automated message for an urgent pickup. A pickup operation was started immediately with a local aircraft, but the pilot could not land because of thin ice. \n  \n A dog travelling with Cornelissen and de Roo was spotted, along with a sled on the ice and another in the water. \n  \n A search and rescue operation, co-ordinated by the Nunavut Emergency Measures Organization, also failed to locate the two expedition members, police say. \n  \n \"They were able to confirm that there was expedition equipment including personal items floating in the water at the location of the distress signal.\" \n  \n In a voice recording he posted online Tuesday, Cornelissen said: \"Today was a good day.\" He described the weather as surprisingly warm, \"too warm actually,\" noting that he ended up skiing in just his underwear and boots. \n  \n \"We think we see thin ice in front of us, which is quite interesting,\" Cornelissen said. \"And we're going to research some more of that if we can.\" \n  \n The release said the two are experienced polar explorers and researchers. ||||| Police have called off the search for two Dutch scientists. Unusually thin ice likely played a role in their presumed death in the Canadian Arctic this week \n  \n In a voicemail on Tuesday, Dutch researcher Marc Cornelissen, founder of Cold Facts, an organization supporting scientific research in polar regions, laughed at his predicament. He explained that unexpectedly warm weather had forced him and fellow explorer Philip de Roo to complete that afternoon’s skiing in the Canadian Arctic in their underwear. \n  \n “I’m glad you guys don’t have pictures of us on the ice,” he said with a chuckle. “But it was the only way to deal with the heat.” \n  \n  \n  \n The same heat had also contributed to melting the sea ice near Bathurst Island, the researchers’ ultimate destination. In his voicemail, Cornelissen said the pair might have to take a detour to the north as there seemed to be thin ice ahead of them. \n  \n That message turned out to be tragically prescient. The next day, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Resolute Bay received an emergency distress message from the team, approximately 200 km south of Bathurst Island. A pilot flying over the area spotted the pair’s equipment in an area with poor ice conditions and open water. Their sled dog was found sitting on the ice nearby. \n  \n Cold Facts researchers on the ice Photograph: Cold Facts \n  \n No further traces of the explorers were found. On Friday, police called off the search. \n  \n Collaborating with other scientists working in the region, the police are attempting to use any available information about the area, as well as recent satellite images from Nasa and the European Space Agency, to try to recover the bodies. So far, the mission has been hindered by the same poor ice conditions that apparently proved fatal for the Dutch explorers. \n  \n Cornelissen and de Roo departed Resolute Bay for Bathurst Island on 6 April as part of the Last Ice Survey expedition, with the goal of exploring and researching an area known as the Last Ice Area. Both were experienced polar explorers and researchers. \n  \n In addition to his work with Cold Facts, de Roo traveled to Antarctica in 2000 to conduct climate research on behalf of the World Wide Fund for Nature. \n  \n Inspirational climate researchers feared dead on Arctic expedition Read more \n  \n Climate and sea ice models have indicated that the region in the high Arctic of Canada and Greenland, where Cornelissen and de Roo were gathering data, will be the last stronghold of summer sea ice as the planet continues to warm. \n  \n “We think we see thin ice in front of us, which is quite interesting, and we’re going to research some of that if we can,” Cornelissen said in his last message. \n  \n Models have projected that summer sea ice will remain there through 2050. Ice researchers in the area hope to determine whether those predictions will bear out. Meanwhile, the World Wildlife Fund is spearheading an effort to launch a sea ice management program in the area to protect the ice for polar bears. \n  \n The type of thin ice Cornelissen and de Roo encountered could be an obstacle to that effort. According to Stephanie Pfirman, an environmental science professor at Barnard College, the latest research brief on the area indicates the region has “less and less of the thick, old ice that persisted from one year to the next. Because the ice is thinner, it is easier to melt all the way through, making it more vulnerable to future warming”. \n  \n Canada’s Arctic ice has been melting at a rapid rate since 2005, according to a 2014 memo from the country’s environmental agency, Natural Resources Canada. The National Research Council presented a report earlier this month that backed up this research. \n  \n “The Arctic is warming faster than just about any place on Earth,” Pfirman said in a conference call about the report. “And the Arctic winters are much milder than they were in the past.” \n  \n Cold Facts’ mission has been to gather data in the world’s polar regions to feed into various ongoing research projects, and information from this expedition would have contributed to the work of scientists studying the rapid melting of the Arctic. “We feed data into existing research activities and do not aspire to be a research program in itself,” the group’s website explains. \n  \n Sadly, gathering further data on the rapidly deteriorating Arctic seems to have cost de Roo and Cornelissen their lives. \n  \n Marielle Feenstra, a spokeswoman for Cold Facts, said the organization would keep the public informed on the progress of the recovery mission, and that it plans to continue the work Cornelissen and de Roo started. ||||| Date: 23 March 2015 – 6 May 2015 \n  \n Location: Canadian Archipelago, Nunavut \n  \n Focus: Measuring snow and ice thickness in the heart of The Last Ice Area \n  \n Team: Marc Cornelissen, Philip de Roo Polar explorers Marc Cornelissen and Philip de Roo (The Netherlands) will head for the Canadian High Arctic / Nunavut to gather valuable datasets for scientific research on sea ice in the heart of the so-called \"Last Ice Area\". This is the area where summer sea ice cover is expected to be most resilient to warming and to remain for decades to come. Anticipating on this resilience, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has identified this region as an area for which special stewardship should be sought through consultation of and cooperation with stakeholders. A solid science base is needed to do this. The expedition will survey areas of mixed ice conditions on skis over a distance of 400 kilometers. First year, multi-year ice, thin ice, and polynyas (open water) are expected to be encountered. The expedition will record knowledge of the ice conditions by interviewing local hunters. Results are shared with the University of York to be able to make interpretations of the measurements, which consist of electromagnetic profiles and drill hole measurements to establish sea ice thickness and snow profiles. Marc Cornelissen Philip de Roo \n  \n Date: 26 November 2014 – 28 March 2015 \n  \n Location: Rothera Station, Antarctica \n  \n Focus: Uptake of carbon dioxide, changes to ocean chemistry and effects on marine life in the Antarctic Ocean \n  \n Team: Dr. Elizabeth Jones - Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Groningen and the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) Human activity has rapidly increased the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. About 40% of the CO2 is taken-up by the oceans which changes the ocean chemistry by reducing the pH and leads to ocean acidification – the other, perhaps not so well known CO2 problem. The West Antarctic Peninsula region has the most rapidly increasing air temperatures of the Southern hemisphere, which leads to warming of the ocean and increased melting of the sea ice and glaciers. The increasing CO2 in Antarctic surface and deep waters is changing the ocean chemistry, which has implications for the whole Antarctic ecosystem. Rothera Research Station, Marguerite Bay, is an excellent ‘natural laboratory’ to study the effects of melt of sea ice and glaciers alongside the changes in ocean chemistry.

Testing and demonstrating protocols and instruments. \n  \n Team: Marc Cornelissen, Petter Nyquist North of Ellef Ringness Island Petter Nyquist and Marc Cornelissen were flown onto the Arctic Ocean for a week long survey on skis. The expedition crossed very thick, compressed multi-year sea ice that was rather consistent with the conditions encountered weeks before in the Lincoln Sea during the CryoVEx operation. The aim was to establish a profile of sea ice thickness and snow cover using an electromagnetic profiler, drill hole measurements, and a snow probe. Protocols and instruments were tested to assess usability by polar explorers and travelers. Originally the aim was to travel towards the coast, but terrain conditions were too difficult to be able to do so. Compressed and complex ice formations and a rather loose snow cover made progress very slow. The obtained data is of high quality, however, and has proven useful to characterise this hardly researched area. Upon start of the expedition, a Cold Facts weather station / ice buoy was deployed and has been tracking meteorological conditions and ice movements flawlessly ever since.

(AP) — Wisconsin Republican lawmakers on Wednesday passed a series of bills to weaken the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. Highlights of the sweeping legislation, which was approved in the lame-duck legislative session: \n  \n — Limit early voting to no more than two weeks before an election. \n  \n — Give the Legislature's budget committee, rather than the attorney general, the power to withdraw the state from lawsuits. That would prevent Democratic Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul from withdrawing Wisconsin from a multi-state lawsuit to repeal the federal Affordable Care Act. \n  \n — Give Republicans in the Legislature the majority of appointments to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the state's quasi-private job-creation agency that Evers wants to reorganize. Evers would also be barred from replacing the leader of the agency until Sept. 1, at which point the number of appointments Evers and Democratic lawmakers can make would be equal to legislative Republicans. \n  \n — Require state health officials to implement a federal waiver allowing Wisconsin to require childless adults under age 50 to work in order to receive health insurance through the BadgerCare Plus program. The legislation prevents Evers from seeking to withdraw the waiver request. \n  \n — Eliminate the attorney general's solicitor general office. The office currently handles some of the highest-profile and most political lawsuits. \n  \n — Require all settlement money the attorney general wins to go to the state's general fund rather than the state Justice Department. \n  \n — Prohibit judges from giving greater weight to state agencies' interpretations of laws in court challenges. That change could make it easier to win lawsuits challenging environmental regulations. \n  \n — Require the governor to get permission from the Legislature before asking for changes in programs run jointly by the state and federal governments, limiting the governor's authority to run public benefits programs. \n  \n — Reduce income tax rates next year to offset about $60 million in online sales taxes from out-of-state retailers. \n  \n — Require the governor to get permission from the Legislature before he could ban guns in the state Capitol. \n  \n — Require state agencies to file quarterly spending reports. \n  \n — Lawmakers did not pass three proposals that were originally part of the package: moving the 2020 presidential primary election; allowing Republican legislative leaders to intervene in lawsuits and hire their own attorneys, pushing aside the attorney general; and instituting a state-level guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions that would have been weaker than the one in place under federal law. ||||| Bob Kinosian, from Wauwatosa, Wis., holds up a sign during the state Christmas Tree lighting ceremony in state Capitol Rotunda Tuesday Dec. 4, 2018, in Madison, Wis.

(AP) — The Latest on Wisconsin Republican lawmakers moving to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general (all times local): \n  \n 8:20 a.m. \n  \n The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature has approved a sweeping package of bills weakening the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. \n  \n The state Assembly approved the lame-duck legislation Wednesday morning. The Wisconsin Senate did the same less than three hours earlier after lawmakers worked through most of the night. \n  \n The bills now go to outgoing Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who has signaled his support. \n  \n The measures would limit the governor's ability to promulgate administrative rules, which enact laws and give lawmakers the power to control appointees to the state economic development agency's board. \n  \n The measures would also require the attorney general to get legislative approval to withdraw from lawsuits. That move is designed to block Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers from allowing the incoming attorney general, Democrat Josh Kaul, to withdraw Wisconsin from a multistate lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act. \n  \n The measures also restrict early in-person voting to two weeks before an election. \n  \n ___ \n  \n 7:50 a.m. \n  \n The Wisconsin Senate has narrowly rejected a bill that would have created a state guarantee that people with pre-existing conditions can have access to health insurance. \n  \n Democrats say the measure provided inadequate coverage and would cause premiums to skyrocket. \n  \n The bill failed by one vote Wednesday during a lame-duck legislative session where Republicans are focused on measures designed to limit the powers of the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. That measure is awaiting a final legislative vote in the state Assembly. \n  \n The pre-existing conditions measure failed after all 15 Democrats in the Senate and two Republicans voted against it. The measure had long been stalled in the Senate due to lack of GOP support. \n  \n Republican Gov. Scott Walker supported the measure, which became an issue in his failed re-election campaign. Walker lost to Democrat Tony Evers, a staunch supporter of the pre-existing coverage guarantee in the federal Affordable Care Act. \n  \n ___ \n  \n 6 a.m. \n  \n The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate has passed a sweeping measure taking power away from the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general, and reducing how long early voting can take place. \n  \n The measure was approved on a 17-16 vote with all Democrats and one Republican voting against it. The Assembly was expected to give final approval later Wednesday morning and send the measure to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who has signaled his support. \n  \n The bill would limit the governor's ability to put in place administrative rules that enact laws and give the Legislature the power to control appointees to the board that runs the state economic development agency until Sept. 1. \n  \n The legislation would also require legislative approval to withdraw from lawsuits, taking that away from the attorney general. \n  \n One provision allowing lawmakers to replace the attorney general with their own attorneys was stricken following all-night negotiations among Republicans. \n  \n ___ \n  \n 4:40 a.m. \n  \n The Wisconsin Legislature is preparing to vote on limiting the powers of the incoming Democratic governor and attorney general. \n  \n Lawmakers were expected to vote early Wednesday morning on the proposal, after spending most of the night hammering out deals in private. The action comes just weeks before Republican Gov. Scott Walker is replaced by Democrat Tony Evers. \n  \n The proposal up for a vote would weaken the governor's power to put in place administrative rules enacting state laws. It would also allow the Legislature to sidestep the attorney general and hire private attorneys. The Legislature, not the governor, would have the majority of appointments on the state's economic development agency that Evers has said he wants to dismantle. \n  \n The power to withdraw Wisconsin from a lawsuit challenging the federal health care law would rest with a legislative committee, rather than the attorney general. \n  \n The proposal would also restrict early voting to no more than two weeks before an election. \n  \n ___ \n  \n 12:45 a.m. \n  \n Republicans who control the Wisconsin Assembly have passed a lame-duck bill enacting a Medicaid work requirement. \n  \n The measure would prevent incoming Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers from withdrawing a federal waiver request to implement the work requirement for able-bodied adults younger than 50. The bill also would require new legislative oversight of waiver requests related to health care made by the governor. \n  \n The Assembly passed the bill 59-32 early Wednesday morning. The Senate passed the proposal earlier in the evening. It now goes to Gov. Scott Walker for his signature. \n  \n The bill is part of a package of Republican lame-duck legislation designed to weaken Evers and incoming Democratic Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul. Debate on the rest of the proposals was expected to stretch into early Wednesday in both houses. \n  \n ___ \n  \n 12:35 a.m. \n  \n Wisconsin Republicans are working through the night to bring together enough votes to pass a sweeping package of lame-duck proposals designed to empower the GOP-controlled Legislature and weaken the incoming Democrat replacing Republican Gov. Scott Walker. \n  \n Republicans pushed on Tuesday night into Wednesday through protests, internal disagreement and Democratic opposition. The measures are designed to weaken both incoming Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers and Democratic Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul. \n  \n Both Evers and Kaul urged Republicans not to do it and warned of lawsuits that would bring more gridlock to Wisconsin when the new administration, and the first divided government in 10 years, takes over. \n  \n The measures would also limit early voting to no more than two weeks before an election, a move Democrats say is illegal. |||||",

                "inputs": "News article:\n\nScientists discover a link between the protective effects of cooling on the brain and prevention of neurodegeneration \n  \n January 14, 2015 \n  \n MRC Press Release | BBC News Article \n  \n Researchers at the Medical Research Council’s Toxicology Unit have identified a protective mechanism that kicks in when body temperature is lowered, activating a process that prevents the loss of brain cells and the connections between them. \n  \n The MRC team discovered that this protective process may be defective in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, contributing to the death of brain cells in these disorders. By simulating the effects of cooling in mice, the scientists have revealed a possible new target for drugs that could protect against neurodegeneration. \n  \n It has long been known that during hibernation, where a mammal’s core temperature cools to well below normal body temperature, synapses (the connections between brain cells) are depleted. This allows the animal to enter a state of ‘torpor’, similar to a very deep sleep but where no brain activity occurs, allowing the animal to survive without nutrition for weeks or months. As the animal comes out of hibernation and warms up, connections between brain cells are reformed and the number of synapses once again rises, restoring normal brain activity. \n  \n In humans, a reduction in body temperature (hypothermia) is known to protect the brain. For example, people have survived hours after a cardiac arrest with no brain damage after falling into icy water. Artificially cooling the brains of babies that have suffered a loss of oxygen at birth is also used to protect against brain damage. \n  \n Cooling and hibernation lead to the production of a number of different proteins in the brain known as ‘cold-shock’ proteins. One of these, RBM3, has been associated with preventing brain cell death, but it has been unclear how it affects synapse degeneration and regeneration. Knowing how these proteins activate synapse regeneration might help scientists find a way of preventing synapse loss, without the need for actual cooling. \n  \n In this study, researchers reduced the body temperature of healthy mice to 16-18ºC – similar to the temperature of a hibernating small mammal – for 45 minutes. They found that the synapses in the brains of these mice, which do not naturally hibernate, also dismantled on cooling and regenerated on re-warming. \n  \n The team then repeated the cooling in mice bred to reproduce features of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s and prion disease) and found that the capacity for synapse regeneration disappeared as the disease progressed, accompanied by a disappearance of RBM3 levels. \n  \n When the scientists artificially boosted levels of the RBM3 protein they found that this alone was sufficient to protect the Alzheimer and prion mice, preventing synapse and brain cell depletion, reducing memory loss and extending lifespan. \n  \n The researchers were therefore able to conclude that RBM3 – and perhaps other cold-shock proteins – affects the ability of neurons to regenerate synapses in neurodegenerative diseases, which is essential to prevent synapse loss during disease progression. The pathway could be a useful target for drugs so that brain cells could be preserved without the need for cooling. \n  \n Professor Giovanna Mallucci, who led the research team, said: “We’ve known for some time that cooling can slow down or even prevent damage to brain cells, but reducing body temperature is rarely feasible in practice: it’s unpleasant and involves risks such as pneumonia and blood clots. But, by identifying how cooling activates a process that prevents the loss of brain cells, we can now work towards finding a means to develop drugs that might mimic the protective effects of cold on the brain.” \n  \n Professor Hugh Perry, chairman of the MRC’s Neurosciences and Mental Health Board, which funded the research, said: “The neuroprotective pathway identified in this study could be an important step forward. We now need to find something to reproduce the effect of brain cooling. Just as anti-inflammatory drugs are preferable to cold baths in bringing down a high temperature, we need to find drugs which can induce the effects of hibernation and hypothermia.” \n  \n Notes to editors \n  \n ‘RBM3 mediates structural plasticity and protective effects of cooling in neurodegeneration’ by Diego Peretti, Amandine Bastide, Helois Radford, Nicholas Verity, Colin Molloy, Maria Guerra Martin, Julie A.

They used these to prevent brain cells dying in animals, and say that restoring lost memories may eventually be possible. \n  \n Experts have described the findings as \"promising\" and \"exciting\". \n  \n In the early stages of Alzheimer's, and other neurodegenerative disorders, synapses are lost. This inevitably progresses to whole brain cells dying. \n  \n But during hibernation, 20-30% of the connections in the brain - synapses - are culled as the body preserves precious resources over winter. \n  \n And remarkably those connections are reformed in the spring, with no loss of memory. \n  \n Hibernation lessons \n  \n In experiments, non-hibernating mice with Alzheimer's disease and prion disease were cooled so their body temperature dropped from 37C to 16-18C. \n  \n Young diseased mice lost synapses during the chill and regained them as they warmed up. \n  \n Old mice also lost brain connections, but were unable to re-establish them. \n  \n Image copyright Thinkstock \n  \n The study, published in the journal Nature, found levels of a \"cold-shock\" chemical called RBM3 soared when young mice were chilled, but not in old mice. \n  \n It suggested RBM3 was key to the formation of new connections. \n  \n In a further set of tests, the team showed the brain cell deaths from prion disease and Alzheimer's could be prevented by artificially boosting RBM3 levels. \n  \n Prof Giovanna Mallucci, from the MRC Toxicology Unit in Leicester, told the BBC News website: \"This gives us a target to develop a drug in the same way paracetamol is used for a fever rather than a cold bath.\" \n  \n Memory back \n  \n Memories can be restored during hibernation as only the receiving end of the synapse shuts down. \n  \n I asked Prof Mallucci if memories could be restored in people if their synapses could be restored: \"Absolutely, because a lot of memory decline is correlated with synapse loss, which is the early stage of dementia, so you might get back some of the synapse you've lost.\" \n  \n The discovery comes from the laboratory that was the first to prevent the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease. \n  \n It is still only an interesting concept, but has attracted some praise. \n  \n Dr Doug Brown, the director of research and development at the Alzheimer's Society said: \"We know that cooling body temperate can protect the brain from some forms of damage and it's interesting to see this protective mechanism now also being studied in neurodegenerative disease. \n  \n \"Connections between brain cells - called synapses - are lost early on in several neurodegenerative conditions, and this exciting study has shown for the first time that switching on a cold-shock protein called RBM3 can prevent these losses. \n  \n \"While we don't think body cooling is a feasible treatment for long-term, progressive conditions like Alzheimer's disease, this research opens up the possibility of finding drugs that can have the same effect. We are very much looking forward to seeing this research taken forward to the next stage.\" \n  \n Dr Eric Karran, the director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the study was \"promising\" and \"highlights a natural process nerve cells use to protect themselves\". \n  \n He added that \"a future treatment able to bolster nerve cells against damage could have wide-reaching benefits\". |||||\nWhat is a shorter version of the above article?",
                "targets": "– During hibernation, animals like bears and mice lose as much as 30% of their synapses as the creatures cool; but those brain connections are recreated when they wake back up however many weeks or months later. Synapses are similarly lost (but, of course, not reformed) in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and that loss correlates with memory loss. Now a team out of the UK is reporting in the journal Nature on the role a \"cold-shock\" protein called RBM3 may play. The team found then when both young and old mice (in this case, a non-hibernating version) with Alzheimer's disease were chilled and then warmed up, only the young ones were able to reform their connections. And in those young mice, RBM3 levels jumped as they cooled; the same wasn't true for their elderly counterparts, reports the BBC. But by boosting RBM3 levels, the team found they could prevent \"synapse and brain cell depletion.\" \"This gives us a target to develop a drug in the same way paracetamol is used for a fever rather than a cold bath,\" one of the lead researchers says. And though it's too early to say whether such an effect will be similar in humans, the lab behind this discovery—the Medical Research Council's Toxicology Unit in Leicester—is the one that first prevented the death of brain tissue in a neurodegenerative disease. \"While we don't think body cooling is a feasible treatment for long-term, progressive conditions like Alzheimer's disease, this research opens up the possibility of finding drugs that can have the same effect,\" an outside researcher says.

According to the BBC, staff with the Alan Nuttall Partnership, which has been operating out of the factory in Dudley for 30 years, found a set of old keys during renovations and discovered they fit an old door on the property. \"We've always known it was here, but this is such a large site there are little corners that no one goes into,\" Nuttall operations director Matt Hornblower says. Behind the basement door, staff found what appears to be the private fire service of the factory's former tenant, the Co-operative Wholesale Society, unused since the 1960s at least. “We came across all of these fascinating finds. There’s a set of seven or eight uniforms,\" Nuttall marketing manager Anna Bamford tells Fox News. “There’s a lot of hoses...There’s even an old gas mask.” There's also a pump that appears to be from the 1930s and a half-empty bottle of Pepsi. The names of firefighters are still chalked above their hanging uniforms, the Express & Star reports. Everything's covered in dust.

Rush Limbaugh, the radio talk show host, accused Republicans of being “totally bamboozled” and lacking in confidence. \n  \n Conducted by the Republican National Committee after the 2012 election defeat, the report is searing in its bluntness. Still, one of the main solutions it offered was new logistics rather than new policies: It called for fewer presidential debates and a shortened primary season, with the Republican National Convention to be held sometime before its traditional date in August or September. ||||| A blunt self-critique by the national Republican Party concludes that while the GOP is flourishing in many state capitals, it is \"increasingly marginalized\" and out of touch at the federal level. \n  \n The national Republican Party released a scathing self-analysis Monday that party leaders hope will be the first step toward returning the GOP to a winning track after its election losses of November. Neil King reports. Photo: AP. \n  \n The Republican National Committee's postmortem of November's election losses, released Monday, draws a contrast between the \"inclusive and appealing\" manner of the country's GOP governors and the party's \"federal wing,\" whose message \"is not working\" beyond core Republican adherents. \n  \n Unless changes are made, the report states, \"it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.\" \n  \n The nearly 100-page analysis—compiled in the past several months by five veteran GOP campaign advisers—describes the party as ideologically rigid, still clinging to the days of Ronald Reagan, unable to speak to a wider electorate and increasingly viewed by voters as indifferent to the struggles of average people. \n  \n Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus, who created the task force to dig into the party's woes and offer remedies, called the assessment the most unsparing and comprehensive ever done by a major political party. \n  \n In focus groups, voters who had left the Republican Party said they found the GOP to be \"scary,\" \"narrow-minded,\" \"out of touch\" and the party of \"stuffy old men.\" \n  \n Jim Brown III, a registered Republican and retired 79-year-old photographer from Naples, Fla., said the party is going to need to do a lot to win him back. \"You don't need 100 pages to determine what's wrong with the Republican Party,\" he said. \"The party is just out of touch, and has left me behind. It needs to catch up with the times.\" \n  \n Most of the scores of prescriptions the RNC panel put forward in the report focus on ways to improve delivery of the party's message. In response, Mr. Priebus said the RNC plans to launch a campaign to reach out to minority groups and young voters, to bolster its online targeting of supporters and to create a permanent campaign presence in a number of states. \n  \n The panel also proposed changes to how the GOP chooses its presidential nominee, such as limiting the number of primary debates, condensing the primary calendar and moving the national convention into the early summer—all in the interest, it said, of protecting and strengthening the eventual nominee. \n  \n A shortened primary schedule with fewer debates would likely help the better-funded candidates, who would have the money to build name recognition, while making it harder for candidates with less funding and possibly insurgent candidates—of which there were many in 2012—to take flight. The nearly two dozen debates during the last GOP primary helped catapult at least five candidates to brief front-runner status. \n  \n At the same time, the party offered some unsparing advice to current lawmakers and future candidates, some of which appears to take issue with the Republican calls for austerity and for limiting the size and scope of government. \n  \n To grow as a party, the RNC assessment points out, Republican policy makers must realize that economically struggling voters \"don't care if the help comes from the private sector or the government—they just want help.\" \n  \n The report notes that \"instead of connecting with voters' concerns, we too often sound like bookkeepers.\" \n  \n House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) took the critique in stride. \"Republicans don't need to have a report to know they've got a long way to grow to move the party forward,\" he said. \n  \n He added, \"many times we don't deliver the message well,\" stressing that Republicans need to \"speak to the heart,\" not just the head. \n  \n The task force generally shied away from taking policy stances, with two exceptions. It said the GOP must embrace \"comprehensive immigration reform,\" which has mostly come to mean a rewrite of laws to give legal status or citizenship to people who entered the country illegally—a proposition opposed by many in the party. \n  \n The task force also said the party \"must in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming\" on social issues, though it didn't specify which issues. The report arrives just as a prominent conservative, Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), has engendered debate in the party by switching his stance to support gay marriage. \n  \n Jesse Ferguson, communications director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, called the report \"a total indictment of the Republican agenda in Congress.\" He suggested that \"someone should probably send Republicans in Congress a copy of the report.\" \n  \n Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 ranking Senate Republican, called the report \"a genuine effort to identify and diagnose the problems we had in this last election.\" \n  \n The report comes at a moment when Republicans aligned with the tea party and insurgent candidates are arguing that conservatives should reject the guidance of party insiders and consultants, urging that they look instead to the GOP's conservative grass roots for renewal. \n  \n One social conservative, former presidential candidate Gary Bauer, called the report an act of \"political navel-gazing.\" He said GOP leaders should \"fire the pollsters\" and adhere to the party's core beliefs. \n  \n \"Millions of Americans vote for Republicans precisely because of the value radicalism of the Democrats,\" Mr. Bauer said. \"We would head off a cliff to abandon them.\" \n  \n Write to Neil King Jr. at neil.king@wsj.com |||||",

When someone rolls their eyes at us, they are not likely to open their ears to us,\" it reads. In focus groups, former Republican voters called the party \"scary\" and say it's full of \"stuffy old men,\" the report notes. If something isn't done, \"it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.\" What does it recommend? \"Comprehensive immigration reform,\" a shift in mega-campaign spending away from TV and toward door-to-door efforts, more tolerance for gays, the formation of an RNC Celebrity Task Force, and an \"inclusive and welcoming\" stance on social issues, among other things. What does it omit? The report doesn't touch on the gay-marriage debate, abortion, or Planned Parenthood, reports Politico. What's next?

REUTERS/Frank Polich \n  \n According to a complaint filed in Chicago federal court, United failed to credit Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Fandrei with sick leave while he was deployed as a KC-10 pilot in southwest Asia from December 2012 to March 2013. \n  \n The U.S. Department of Justice said the Chicago-based carrier did this despite offering such benefits to other employees on similar leave, violating the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). \n  \n “USERRA ensures that service members like Lt. Col. Fandrei who answer our nation’s call to duty don’t return to civilian life and find their employment benefits denied and their civil rights violated,” Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said in a statement. \n  \n In a statement, the carrier said it believes its policies comply with USERRA, and that it is “committed to supporting the many aviation professionals at our airline who served or who are currently serving in the military.” \n  \n United’s parent is United Continental Holdings Inc UAL.N. \n  \n The lawsuit seeks to recoup the value of Fandrei’s lost benefits, and an injunction against similar violations. \n  \n It is part of the U.S. government’s effort to ensure that military personnel are not penalized for serving their country, including legal actions to stop improper home foreclosures and car repossessions. \n  \n The Justice Department said Fandrei, of Fairfield, California, worked at the time of his deployment for Continental Airlines, whose contract with its pilots did not let them accrue sick leave during military deployments. \n  \n United and Continental had merged in 2010. \n  \n According to the complaint, Fandrei was commissioned as an Air Force officer in 1990, and retired from the Air Force Reserve as of Jan. 1, 2016. \n  \n He joined United as a pilot in 2000, and was recalled from a furlough six months before being deployed, the complaint said. ||||| United Airlines is facing a lawsuit claiming it violated an Air Force reservist's employment rights by failing to credit him for sick leave during a military deployment. \n  \n Chicago-based United allegedly let employees on certain types of leave accrue sick time, but not a pilot on military leave during his active duty deployment in 2012 and 2013, according to a news release from the U.S. Justice Department. \n  \n U.S. Air Force Reservist Lt.

Daniel Fandrei was called to active duty in 2012, he could have rightfully expected to continue to accrue sick leave while away from United. After all, United allows employees accrue time off while they're on vacation or home sick, the Chicago Tribune reports. Fandrei would have been wrong. According to Reuters, the federal government sued United on Monday for violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, which, as one Justice Department employee puts it, makes sure service members \"don't return to civilian life and find their employment benefits denied and their civil rights violated.\" Fandrei joined the Air Force in 1990 and started flying for United in 2000. He was called to active duty in December 2012 and spent the next few months flying refueling tankers in southwest Asia, Consumerist reports. The government argues Fandrei should have accrued 10 hours of sick leave during that time, as employees on certain types of non-military leave would have. United disagrees. The government is seeking the monetary equivalent of 10 hours of sick leave on behalf of Fandrei and to force United to comply with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act."

Scout was a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student... (Associated Press) \n  \n ATLANTA (AP) — Three people were arrested Monday night during a protest after a vigil for a Georgia Tech student who was fatally shot by campus police, a university spokesman said. \n  \n Police shot and killed Scout Schultz late Saturday night after the 21-year-old student called 911 to report an armed and possibly intoxicated suspicious person, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said. \n  \n Georgia Tech sent out alerts urging students to shelter indoors Monday night and lock doors and windows because of violent protests. Video posted on social media showed a police vehicle burning in the street and officers pinning people to the ground as onlookers shouted at them. \n  \n After a peaceful vigil, about 50 protesters marched to the campus police department, university spokesman Lance Wallace said. A police vehicle was damaged and two officers suffered minor injuries, with one taken to a hospital for treatment. \n  \n Police restored order relatively quickly, and three people were arrested and charged with inciting a riot and battery of an officer, Wallace said. \n  \n In a statement released through attorney Chris Stewart, Schultz's family urged protesters to remain peaceful. \n  \n \"(W)e ask that those who wish to protest Scout's death do so peacefully. Answering violence with violence is not the answer,\" the statement said. \"Our goal is to work diligently to make positive change at Georgia Tech in an effort to ensure a safer campus for all students.\" \n  \n The GBI has said an officer responding to a 911 call about 11:17 p.m. Saturday shot Schultz as the student advanced on officers with a knife and refused commands to put down the knife. Stewart said Monday that the GBI confirmed to him that Schultz was holding a multipurpose tool and that the knife blade was not out. \n  \n Schultz was the one who called 911, GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles said in an emailed statement Monday. \n  \n \"In the call, Shultz describes the person as a white male, with long blonde hair, white T-shirt and blue jeans who is possibly intoxicated, holding a knife and possibly armed with a gun on his hip,\" Miles said, adding that three suicide notes were found in Schultz's dorm room. \n  \n Investigators recovered a multi-purpose tool at the scene but didn't find any guns, Miles said. \n  \n Flanked by Schultz's parents Monday morning, Stewart said the officer who shot Schultz overreacted. Schultz was having a breakdown and was suicidal but if the officer had used non-lethal force rather than shooting, Schultz could have received treatment and gotten better, Stewart said. \n  \n \"The mentally ill are looking for a way out when they're having a full breakdown, and there's no way you should be able to use a police officer to take your life when that person isn't threatened,\" Stewart said. \n  \n Georgia Tech police don't carry stun guns, but are equipped with pepper spray, a spokesman told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \n  \n Stewart says he plans to sue over the shooting. \n  \n Authorities have not identified the officer who shot Schultz. Georgia Tech on Monday refused to release personnel or disciplinary reports involving the officers, saying such information is exempt from Georgia's open records law. \n  \n Schultz was president of Pride Alliance at Georgia Tech. The fourth-year computer engineering student used the name Scout, rather than the given name Scott, and preferred the pronouns \"they\" and \"them\" rather than \"he\" or \"him.\" \n  \n \"I'm bisexual, nonbinary and intersex,\" Schultz wrote in a Pride Alliance profile. \n  \n William Schultz told reporters Monday that his child had a 3.9 GPA and was on track to graduate early in December. \n  \n Lynne Schultz told the Journal-Constitution over the weekend that her oldest child had struggled with depression and attempted suicide two years ago using a belt as a noose. \n  \n After that, Scout Schultz went through counseling, William Schultz said. Scout Schultz spent this past summer at home and there were no obvious problems when school resumed last month, the elder Schultz said. \n  \n The GBI, through its Crisis Intervention Team, has trained about 10,000 local, state and federal law enforcement officers since it began in 2004, the Atlanta newspaper reported. Some agencies require that training while others don't. \n  \n It wasn't immediately clear whether the officers who responded Saturday had undergone such training. \n  \n Stewart, the family's lawyer, said the university has failed in not providing its officers with stun guns. He also said university police officers \"should have the highest training in dealing with people having mental or emotional breakdowns and issues.\" \n  \n Referring to a video of the incident, Stewart says the main officer was doing a \"phenomenal job\" handling the situation — retreating, trying to deescalate and putting a barrier between himself and Schultz — and that other officers also appeared to be providing appropriate backup. But one officer behaved inappropriately by firing on Schultz when there was no immediate danger to any of the officers, Stewart said. \n  \n William Schultz said the encounter shouldn't have ended in his child's death. \n  \n If given a chance to talk to the officer, he told reporters, he just has one question: \"Why did you have to shoot? That's the question. I mean, that's the only question that matters right now. Why did you kill my son?\" \n  \n ___ \n  \n Associated Press writer Jeff Martin contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Protests break out on campus after a peaceful vigil for slain student ends \n  \n A police car is burned, arrests are made \n  \n (CNN) Violence erupted late Monday on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta after a vigil for a student shot and killed by police. \n  \n Attendees at the vigil for Scout Schultz said that gathering ended quietly after less than half an hour, and about 20 minutes later a separate gathering developed with chanting, marching and, ultimately, confrontations at the campus police headquarters. \n  \n A campus police car burned after its windshield was smashed, and videos taken by people at the scene showed police handcuffing individuals who had been forced to the ground. \n  \n Georgia Tech said in a statement late Monday that about 50 people had marched to the police station. Three arrests were made and two officers received minor injuries. Those arrested were charged with inciting a riot and battery of an officer, Tech said, although it did not say whether the three were students. \n  \n The later demonstration began with a \"core group\" of about a dozen people chanting \"This is not OK\" and unfurling a banner that read \"Protect LGBTQ,\" according to Xincheng Shen, a doctoral student at Tech who attended the earlier vigil. \n  \n Read More ||||| Anger over the police shooting of a Pride Alliance leader at Georgia Tech turned violent Monday night, as protesters set a campus police car ablaze following a candlelight vigil. \n  \n Two police officers received minor injuries, Tech spokesman Lance Wallace said.

Arrest warrants said Monden attempted to kick in a front windshield of a police car. \n  \n On Saturday, Sept. 16, a caller, later identified as Scout Schultz contacted 911 to report a suspicious person on campus. Soon afterward, Schultz was shot dead by a Georgia Tech campus police officer. The following 911 call was released to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation through an open records request. \n  \n Castillenti, 31, was charged with felonies including aggravated assault on an officer, along with willful obstruction of an officer by use of threats or violence. Arrest warrants said Castillenti hit an officer in the head with a hammer while the officer was arresting another protester, and sprayed a different officer with pepper spray when the officer was attempting to arrest him. \n  \n The three are expected in court for first appearance hearings Wednesday morning. \n  \n The parents of Scout Schultz — who had appeared earlier in the day with their attorney to question the deadly shooting — released a statement Monday night calling for calm. \n  \n “We ask that those who wish to protest Scout's death do so peacefully. Answering violence with violence is not the answer. Our goal is to work diligently to make positive change at Georgia Tech in an effort to ensure a safer campus for all students,” they said. \n  \n “This is how we will truly honor Scout's life and legacy.” \n  \n A vehicle burns after a vigil for a Georgia Tech student who was shot dead by campus police turns violent on Sept. 18, 2017. \n  \n Students planned to set up tables across campus from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday “for ... campus members to write letters and on posters to show support for Scout's family and friends (as tonights vigil was interrupted) as well as GTPD,” according to a Facebook post. \n  \n Early Tuesday, a Georgia Tech worker pressure washed the spot where a police car burned during a night of violent protests on the campus. JOHN SPINK / JSPINK@AJC.COM (0) \n  \n The evening began with a peaceful vigil to remember Scout Schultz, a 21-year-old engineering student from Lilburn. Schultz was gunned down by campus police late Saturday night. The GBI is investigating. \n  \n But about 50 students left the vigil and began to march toward the Tech police headquarters at Hemphill Avenue and Ferst Drive. \n  \n At 9:28 p.m., Georgia Tech tweeted that students should “shelter in place” due to “violent protests on campus.” Officers from the Atlanta Police and nearby Georgia State University were called in to to assist Georgia Tech police. \n  \n GTENS ALERT: Stay inside due to violent protests on campus. Avoid Hemphill Avenue. Stay inside until told otherwise. — Georgia Tech (@GeorgiaTech) September 19, 2017 \n  \n Chad Miller, a Tech alumnus taking part in the march, said he thought tear gas had been deployed. Miller told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he was right behind the police car when it erupted into flames. \n  \n “All I heard was metal hitting metal,” Miller said. “I’m guessing it was fireworks, there were some pretty powerful ones.” \n  \n “I was marching with them until they got in front of the police station and then all hell broke loose.” \n  \n Miller said he saw one man who may have been a police officer throwing up and coughing. \n  \n Friends embrace on Monday, September 18, 2017, during a vigil in memory of Scout Schultz, a student and leader in the LGBTQIA community at Georgia Tech. The vigil was held at the Kessler Campanile at Georgia Tech in Atlanta after Scout Schultz was killed during an encounter with campus police. Pride Alliance and Progressive Student Alliance hosted the vigil. ((Rebecca Breyer) for The AtlantaJournal-Constitution) (Rebecca Breyer) \n  \n Schultz was shot and killed after a confrontation with Georgia Tech campus police late Saturday night. Police have said Schultz had a knife and refused commands to stop. \n  \n But Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the family, said Schultz was carrying a small utility tool and the blade wasn’t out. \n  \n Schultz’s parents have questioned why police didn’t use non-lethal force. \n  \n The GBI said Monday Schultz had left behind three suicide notes and called 911. \n  \n “Why did you have to shoot?” Scout’s father, Bill Schultz asked at a news conference Monday. “That’s the only question that matters right now.” \n  \n  \n  \n Schultz was the head of the Georgia Pride Alliance, which had helped organize Monday night’s vigil.

Louise told CNN that authorities had her sign paperwork stating \"if we step outside, they are going to take us ... to court (because) we'll have committed a crime.\" \n  \n So there she has stayed, along with her 13-year-old son and two nephews in their 20s. But it hasn't been easy. \n  \n Louise told CNN's Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour, and based on that and everything else, isn't sick.

There was also the matter of their power going out, which was likely related to strong storms that rolled through the area. Then, of course, there's the idea of living in a place that -- just a few days ago -- was home to an Ebola sufferer. \n  \n Her 35-year-old daughter brought over Clorox to help clean the house, and she sealed up Duncan's dirty clothes and towels in a bag. \n  \n \"But (authorities) said we shouldn't throw anything away until they can get back with me,\" Louise said. \n  \n That hadn't happened as of Thursday evening. Men in trucks from Cleaning Guys, a company that specializes in hazmat and biohazard cleaning services, was turned away for lack of the necessary permit to transport hazardous waste on Texas highways, it said. \n  \n Once everything is cleaned up, even if plenty of food arrives, Louise's ordeal is far from over. \n  \n First off, there's the fact Duncan -- who flew from Liberia to visit her and family members -- is still in the hospital, fighting a disease that's already killed thousands in West Africa. \n  \n And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment. That's because Ebola can be in a person for that long before it manifests itself, and someone starts to feel sick. \n  \n Reflecting on it all, Louise said Thursday, \"I'm just hanging in there, depending on God to save our lives.\" \n  \n County official: Quarantined four should be relocated \n  \n If it were up to the Dallas County director of homeland security, the four people quarantined shouldn't be stuck in the apartment at all. \n  \n Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said officials are working on that relocation after Duncan's partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions. \n  \n Jenkins acknowledged \"some hygiene issues\" in the apartment. \n  \n \"I would like to see those people moved to better living conditions,\" Jenkins told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday afternoon. \"We are working on that. I would like to move them five minutes ago.\" \n  \n Jenkins acknowledged problems with Louise's apartment but defended the overall government response. \n  \n \"We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment,\" Jenkins said earlier in the day. \"Those people in the apartment are part of Dallas County, and they're going to be treated with utmost respect and dignity in this unusual situation. \n  \n JUST WATCHED Everything you need to know about Ebola in Texas Replay More Videos ...

Nor was he showing any signs of the virus. \n  \n But things changed three days later, when Duncan got a headache and a fever, according to his partner. \n  \n On September 25, she took him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where, Louise said, hospital staff were told twice that Duncan had come from Liberia. But \"they did not ask\" him anything about Ebola, including whether he'd had contact with anyone with the disease in Africa, according to Louise. \n  \n Duncan was taken by ambulance to the hospital on Sunday, September 28, after Louise's 35-year-old daughter saw him \"shaking really hard\" and with a fever when she came by to give him tea. \n  \n Louise said she went to the hospital herself soon thereafter, seeing Duncan \"through the glass.\" \n  \n It was then that health officials first told her that medical officials first told her that her partner may have Ebola. \n  \n \"I was so (scared),\" Louise said. \n  \n Did authorities drop the ball? \n  \n So, too, is Peterson Wayne. \n  \n But Wayne doesn't want his 13-year-old son, who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother, Louise -- to know that what he's feeling. So every time they talk on the phone, Wayne said he want \"just to encourage him,\" not to frighten him. \n  \n \"I believe he knows everything,\" said Wayne, who is no longer with the boy's mother but is still pulling for her. \"(There's) no need for me to just go and talk about Ebola.\" \n  \n Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived. \n  \n He said that Duncan had come to Texas to \"help his son\" and visit his family. \n  \n Asked about health authorities have handled the quarantine, including the sweat-stained sheets and lack of food, Smallwood conceded that he's \"skeptical.\" \n  \n \"That worries me now, yes.\" \n  \n He's not alone. \n  \n Dr. Irwin Redlener, a professor at Columbia University's school of public health, called the handling of the quarantine \"hair raising.\" \n  \n \"If, in fact, there was a health worker there every day, what exactly were they doing other than just taking her temperature and leaving?\" Redlener said. \"It should have been a whole lot more that (Louse) should be expecting.\" \n  \n Ebola only spreads through infected bodily fluids. And it's distinctly possible that no one around Duncan got exposed to his. (Louise said she didn't think she had.) \n  \n Still, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets, on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating, are disturbing. \n  \n \"We've talked about the fact that this virus can live outside the body, can live on surfaces. It's unlikely for it to be transmitted to someone else that way,\" Gupta said. \n  \n \"But why take a chance?\" \n  \n Gupta said that \"it is hard to believe (the oversight) and there aren't good explanations here.\" \n  \n One Ebola expert, Dr. Alexander van Tulleken , also said the federal response to the first Ebola case on U.S. soil seemed troubling. \n  \n \"So far, we don't seem to reacting as well as we could,\" he said. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than 3,330 people have died in Africa from the deadly Ebola outbreak \n  \n A cameraman working in Liberia has tested positive for Ebola and is to be flown home to the US for treatment. \n  \n The 33-year-old freelancer has been working in the country for three years for a number of media outlets, most recently NBC News. \n  \n More than 3,330 people have died in four West African countries in what has become the world's worst outbreak. \n  \n President Barack Obama has pledged federal support to contain the spread in the US, after the first case there. \n  \n A Liberian man diagnosed in Texas on Tuesday remains in a serious condition. \n  \n The unnamed cameraman is the fourth American known to test positive for Ebola, all diagnosed in Liberia. \n  \n Three American aid workers were separately flown back to the US for treatment and they are all recovering. \n  \n The man was only hired by NBC News on Tuesday, the US broadcaster said, and he came down with symptoms - including fever and aches - the following day. \n  \n After seeking medical advice, he tested positive for the virus. \n  \n Image copyright AP Image caption Duncan was a driver for a courier company in Monrovia \n  \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Frankfurt University Hospital prepares to receive an Ebola patient from Africa \n  \n NBC News President Deborah Turness informed staff of the news in a statement. \n  \n \"We are doing everything we can to get him the best care possible.

In addition, they downloaded \"The Anarchist Cookbook\" and watched videos about building bombs, court documents allege. \n  \n Also in meetings with the undercover FBI agent, Velentzas expressed anger over U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and she suggested she and Siddiqui be referred to as \"citizens of the Islamic State,\" according to charging documents. She also allegedly watched ISIS propaganda videos with the undercover agent. \n  \n Two weeks ago, after news broke about Pugh's arrest, she said she didn't understand why people wanted to join ISIS overseas when there are ways of “pleasing Allah” here in the United States, court documents say. \n  \n She allegedly said she was looking \"to make history,\" and in late December she and the FBI agent discussed possible targets for a bombing. \n  \n \"We are living ... the last war, the big war before the end of day starts, in English they call it Armageddon, we are actually living in that time, it’s not a joke, it starts in Syria,\" she allegedly told the undercover agent. \n  \n Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Velentzas or the undercover agent, Siddiqui had acquired what she later described as \"everything,\" including four propane tanks. She also downloaded instructions on how to those tanks in building a bomb, according to court documents. \n  \n In fact, authorities say nine years earlier, Siddiqui \"became close with Samir Khan,\" the American who joined AQAP and then became editor of Inspire magazine, the terrorist group's online propaganda magazine. Khan published the article “Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,” which has since played a prominent role in so many terror plots, including the Boston bombing. \n  \n It’s unclear exactly why the two were arrested this morning. But court documents say Siddiqui \"recently” suggested they each work on their own plans for jihad. And in November, Velentzas became suspicious that they may be working with an undercover agent. She then conducted research online, trying to determine whether the person they were dealing with was actually any FBI agent, court documents say. \n  \n Such arrests tied to ISIS have become a regular occurrence recently. \n  \n Last week, two cousins were arrested in Chicago -- one of them a current member of the Illinois National Guard -- for allegedly trying to launch attacks in the U.S. and overseas on behalf of ISIS. They were also nabbed in an FBI undercover operation, and both men had been under FBI surveillance for months, federal authorities said. \n  \n The week before, the indictment against New Jersey native Pugh, 47, was announced. He had been living overseas for years but was secretly arrested three months ago after being deported back to the United States. On his laptop, FBI agents allegedly discovered more than 180 jihadist propaganda videos and noticed he had been conducting online searches for such phrases as \"borders controlled by Islamic state,\" \"kobani border crossing,\" and \"who controls kobani.\" \n  \n Two months ago, three New York City men were arrested on charges they allegedly conspired to join ISIS but also expressed willingness to carry out attacks on the terror group's behalf in the United States. The men had planned to travel to the Middle East and had also pledged to launch attacks in this country, including one on President Obama or planting a bomb in Coney Island, Brooklyn, federal officials said. \n  \n Over the past 18 months, more than 30 people have been charged with joining terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq or trying to do so. \n  \n Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

                "targets": "– There have been a raft of ISIS-related arrests on American soil lately, and the latest are two women living together in Queens. As the New York Times reports, a federal indictment unsealed today reveals that Noelle Velentzas, 28, and Asia Siddiqui, 31, both American citizens, have been charged with plotting to detonate a bomb. Per the complaint: Siddiqui “is currently in possession of multiple propane gas tanks, as well as instructions for how to transform propane tanks into explosive devices.\" Velentzas and Siddiqui were radicalized at least partly by ISIS, reports ABC News, which adds that the charges are the result of an undercover FBI sting. The pair were arrested earlier today and are expected in court this afternoon."

When the family begins to feel the financial impact of war, Albert' s father secretly sells Joey to an army officer named Captain Nicholls. Albert begs the captain to let him join the army. Albert is too young, but Nicholls promises to take good care of Joey for him. \n\nNicholls treats Joey well. Though Joey still remembers Albert, he grows to like his new master. He develops a friendship with another horse, Topthorn., who belongs to Nicholls' friend, Captain Stewart. The horses and men are shipped overseas for battle. They soon face their own battle in France, and Captain Nicholls is killed. \n\nA young soldier named Warren becomes Joey's new owner. Joey and Topthorn do well in battle, but the Germans capture Warren and Stewart and their horses. The horses' duty of pulling carts full of wounded German soldiers earns them praise.

Joey and Topthorn are content to work the farm until another band of soldiers takes them. They become workhorses under bad conditions.

But while Diana was mourned in unity by millions as the \"people's princess,\" Thatcher's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways. \n\nWATCH: Not everyone's mourning Thatcher's death \n\nIt has become an overused adjective in the media that Thatcher was \"divisive.\" Some countries might put aside political differences and unite to respect the passing of a leader -- especially the first and only female PM, who won three successive general elections. But in the UK debate about Thatcher is raging almost as fiercely as it did in the 1980s over issues like the privatization of industries, the Falklands War, tax and social policy, her close relationship with American President Ronald Reagan and combative stance against the European Union. \n\nTo many she was the woman who broke the mold, showing the way for others, and the leader who made \"Britain great again,\" according to PM David Cameron. Geri Halliwell, aka \"Ginger Spice\" from the 1990s girl band the Spice Girls, spoke for many when she tweeted this tribute: \"Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter who taught me anything is possible...x.\" Halliwell later deleted the tweet in the face of online criticism, but went on to regret the move, describing herself as \"weak\" and cowardly. \n\nBased on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions.\n\n1.

From its first application, the word has been definitely connected more with women than with men. It first appeared in 1882, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, mentioning \"a lady manager who was extremely bossy\".

                "inputs": "(CNN) -- Venezuela's top election official said Thursday that authorities will complete a 100% audit of votes cast in Sunday's presidential election. \n\nTibisay Lucena, president of Venezuela's National Electoral Council, said officials decided on the audit after a lengthy debate. \n\nOfficials had already audited 54% of ballot boxes, and now will audit the remaining 46%, she said. \n\nREAD MORE: Why Venezuela is so divided \n\nThe decision comes after opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski filed complaints with election officials about thousands of alleged violations during Sunday's vote. \n\n\"The electoral power is making this decision in order to preserve a climate of harmony between Venezuelans, but also to isolate violent sectors that are irresponsibly trying to harm democracy,\" Lucena said. \n\nCapriles said he accepted the council's decision Thursday because he believes that the problems his campaign spotted would be detected in the audit of the remaining 46%. \n\n\"I want to congratulate our people, because this was your fight,\" Capriles said late Thursday. \n\nEarlier this week, Lucena certified the election results and declared Nicolas Maduro president-elect, despite Capriles' calls for a vote-by-vote recount. \n\nMaduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while Capriles won 49%, election officials said earlier this week. \n\nMaduro is scheduled to be sworn in at a ceremony in Caracas on Friday. It was unclear late Thursday whether the audit would impact plans for his inauguration. \n\nThe audit will take about 30 days and will involve comparing results from voting machines with printed reports and registries containing voters' signatures, Venezuelan constitutional lawyer Jose Vicente Haro told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. \n\nAnswer the following questions:\n1.

Here are five things you need to know about the much-loved pontiff. \n\n1. He was born in poverty -- and proud of it \n\nAngelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the man who would become Pope John XXIII, was the third of 13 surviving children born to a family of farmers in the tiny village of Sotto il Monte, near Bergamo, northern Italy in November 1881. \n\nRoncalli left home to study for the priesthood at the age of 11, but even after he became Pope in 1958 at the age of 76 he eschewed the trappings of his position, and refused to take advantage of it either for himself or his family. \n\nIn his last will and testament, Pope John XXIII wrote: \"Born poor, but of humble and respected folk, I am particularly happy to die poor. \n\n\"I thank God for this grace of poverty to which I vowed fidelity in my youth... which has strengthened me in my resolve never to ask for anything -- positions, money or favors -- never either for myself of for my relations and friends.\" \n\nWhen John XXIII died in June 1963 he was mourned around the world as \"Il Papa Buono\" (\"The Good Pope\"). He left his personal \"fortune\" to the surviving members of his family -- they each received less than $20. \n\nBased on the article and the following list of answers, write a list of questions.\n\n1.
